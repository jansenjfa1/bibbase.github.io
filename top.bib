The pathophysiological mechanism remains to be revealed. The present study examined whether local hippocampal microstructure and white matter connectivity are related to type 2 diabetes and memory performance. Forty participants with type 2 diabetes and 38 participants without type 2 diabetes underwent detailed cognitive assessment and 3-Tesla diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion MRI was performed to assess microstructure (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) and white matter connectivity (tract volume) of the hippocampus, which were compared between participants with and without type 2 diabetes. No differences in hippocampal microstructure were observed. Participants with type 2 diabetes had fewer white matter connections between the hippocampus and frontal lobe (P = 0.017). Participants who scored lower on memory function, regardless of type 2 diabetes, had fewer white matter connections between the hippocampus and temporal lobe (P = 0.017). Taken together, type 2 diabetes and memory decrements appear to be associated with altered hippocampal white matter connectivity.},

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 19 HNSCC patients underwent pre- and intra-treatment DCE-MRI scans at a 1.5T MRI scanner. All patients had chemo-radiation treatment. Pharmacokinetic modeling was performed on the acquired DCE-MRI images, generating maps of volume transfer rate (K(trans)) and volume fraction of the extravascular extracellular space (ve). Image texture analysis was then employed on maps of K(trans) and ve, generating two texture measures: Energy (E) and homogeneity.
RESULTS: No significant changes were found for the mean and standard deviation for K(trans) and ve between pre- and intra-treatment (P {\textgreater} 0.09). Texture analysis revealed that the imaging biomarker E of ve was significantly higher in intra-treatment scans, relative to pretreatment scans (P {\textless} 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Chemo-radiation treatment in HNSCC significantly reduces the heterogeneity of tumors.},

Patients with the metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for diabetes, may display comparable cognitive decrements as seen in type 2 diabetes. Currently, the impact of diabetes and prediabetes on cognition and the underlying organization of functional brain networks still remain to be elucidated. This study investigated whether functional brain networks are affected in type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Forty-seven participants with diabetes, 47 participants with prediabetes, and 45 control participants underwent detailed cognitive testing and 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI. Graph theoretical network analysis was performed to investigate alterations in functional cerebral networks. Participants with diabetes displayed altered network measures, characterized by a higher normalized cluster coefficient and higher local efficiency, compared with control participants. The network measures of the participants with prediabetes fell between those with diabetes and control participants. Lower processing speed was associated with shorter path length and higher global efficiency. Participants with type 2 diabetes have altered functional brain networks. This alteration is already apparent in the prediabetic stage to a somewhat lower level, hinting at functional reorganization of the cerebral networks as a compensatory mechanism for cognitive decrements.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although ethosuximide is one of the oldest antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), little information is available about the cognitive side effects of ethosuximide.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive profile of ethosuximide.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used an extensive neuropsychological test battery in patients with epilepsy aged 6-16 years who were treated with monotherapy ethosuximide. We evaluated the efficacy of the drug by seizure frequency (seizure free or not).
RESULTS: We included 61 patients with a mean age of 9.4 years [standard deviation (SD) 2.7] who used on average 686 mg/day (SD 245) ESM as monotherapy. ESM was effective in the majority of the patients (70 \% were seizure free for at least 6 months at moment of inclusion). The total study population showed impairments of intelligence, visuomotor, and attentional function including activation/alertness. Comparisons between the well-controlled patients and patients who were not in remission showed significantly lower intelligence values and lower performance on the visual-perceptual and attentional tasks for the group with ongoing seizures. Our results suggested that the higher order cognitive dysfunctions (such as intelligence and visual-perceptual functions) may be regarded as seizure or aetiology effects and that the impaired fluid cognitive functions, such as activation/alertness, sustained auditory attention and attentional control or switching, were due to ESM.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests the attentional dysfunction resulting in psychomotor slowing and alertness deficits may be regarded as effects of ethosuximide. Although no untreated baseline assessment was available, these effects are comparable to those of other AEDs, and ethosuximide may therefore be considered an AED with only mild effects on cognition. As ethosuximide is a first-line therapy for absence seizures in childhood, and drug-induced cognitive impairment may interfere with development, learning, and academic achievement, these findings are of interest to clinicians who prescribe this drug, especially when informing parents.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are effective in suppressing epileptic seizures, they also induce (cognitive) side effects, with mental slowing as a general effect. This study aimed to assess whether concentrations of MR detectable neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, are associated with mental slowing in patients with epilepsy taking AEDs.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from patients with localization-related epilepsy using a variety of AEDs from three risk categories, i.e., AEDs with low, intermediate, and high risks of developing cognitive problems. Patients underwent 3T MR spectroscopy, including a PRESS (n=55) and MEGA-PRESS (n=43) sequence, to estimate occipital glutamate and GABA concentrations, respectively. The association was calculated between neurotransmitter concentrations and central information processing speed, which was measured using the Computerized Visual Searching Task (CVST) and compared between the different risk categories.
RESULTS: Combining all groups, patients with lower processing speeds had lower glutamate concentrations. Patients in the high-risk category had a lower glutamate concentration and lower processing speed compared with patients taking low-risk AEDs. Patients taking intermediate-risk AEDs also had a lower glutamate concentration compared with patients taking low-risk AEDs, but processing speed did not differ significantly between those groups. No associations were found between the GABA concentration and risk category or processing speed.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a relation is shown between glutamate concentration and both mental slowing and AED use. It is suggested that the reduced excitatory action, reflected by lowered glutamate concentrations, may have contributed to the slowing of information processing in patients using AEDs with higher risks of cognitive side effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive impairment is an important non-motor symptom heralding the development of dementia. Effective treatments to slow down the rate of cognitive decline in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment are lacking. Here, we describe the design of the Parkin'Play study, which assesses the effects of a cognitive health game intervention on cognition in PD.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a multicentre, phase-II, open-randomized clinical trial that aims to recruit 222 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment. Eligible patients have PD, Hoehn \& Yahr stages I-III, are aged between 40 and 75 years, and have cognitive impairment but no dementia. The intervention group (n = 111) will be trained using a web-based health game targeting multiple cognitive domains. The control group (n = 111) will be placed on a waiting list. In order to increase compliance the health game adapts to the subjects' performance, is enjoyable, and can be played at home. From each group, 20 patients will undergo fMRI to test for potential functional brain changes underlying treatment. The primary outcome after 12 weeks of training is cognitive function, as assessed by a standard neuropsychological assessment battery and an online cognitive assessment. The neuropsychological assessment battery covers the following domains: executive function, memory, visual perception, visuoconstruction and language. A compound score for overall cognitive function will be calculated as the mean score of all test Z-scores based on the distribution of scores for both groups taken together. Secondary outcomes at follow-up visits up to 24 weeks include various motor and non-motor symptoms, compliance, and biological endpoints (fMRI).
DISCUSSION: This study aims at evaluating whether a cognitive intervention among PD patients leads to an increased cognitive performance on targeted domains. Strengths of this study are a unique web-based health game intervention, the large sample size, a control group without intervention and innovations designed to increase compliance.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may occur in normal aging but may also play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), we used dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI to quantify the rate and the spatial extent of BBB leakage in patients with cSVD and age- and sex-matched controls to discern cSVD-related BBB leakage from aging-related leakage.
METHODS: We performed structural brain MRI and DCE-MRI in 80 patients with clinically overt cSVD and 40 age- and sex-matched controls. Using the Patlak pharmacokinetic model, we calculated the leakage rate. The mean leakage rate and relative leakage volume were calculated using noise-corrected histogram analysis. Leakage rate and leakage volume were compared between patients with cSVD and controls for the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cortical gray matter (CGM), and deep gray matter.
RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors showed that the leakage volume of the NAWM, WMH, and CGM was significantly larger in patients with cSVD compared with controls. No significant difference was found for leakage rate in any of the tissue regions.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a larger tissue volume with subtle BBB leakage in patients with cSVD than in controls. This was shown in the NAWM, WMH, and CGM, supporting the generalized nature of cSVD.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is associated with microvascular and parenchymal alterations. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI has been proposed to simultaneously measure both the microvascular perfusion and parenchymal diffusivity. This study aimed to evaluate the application of IVIM in cSVD to assess the microvasculature and parenchymal microstructure.
METHODS: Seventy-three patients with cSVD (age 70 ± 11 y) and thirty-nine controls (age 69 ± 12 y) underwent IVIM imaging (3T). Group differences of the perfusion volume fraction f and the parenchymal diffusivity D were investigated using multivariable linear regression accounted for age, sex and cardiovascular factors. To examine the relation between the IVIM measures and the disease severity on structural MRI, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load served as surrogate measure of the disease severity.
RESULTS: Patients had a larger f (p {\textless} 0.024) in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) than controls. Higher D (p {\textless} 0.031) was also observed for patients compared with controls in the NAWM and grey matter. Both f (p {\textless} 0.024) and D (p {\textless} 0.001) in the NAWM and grey matter increased with WMH load.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased diffusivity reflects the predicted microstructural tissue impairment in cSVD. Unexpectedly, an increased perfusion volume fraction was observed in patients. Future studies are needed to reveal the precise nature of the increased perfusion volume fraction. IVIM imaging showed that the increases of f and D in cSVD were both related to disease severity, which suggests the potential of IVIM imaging to provide a surrogate marker for the progression of cSVD.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the wavelet entropy for the characterization of intrinsic aberrant temporal irregularities in the time series of resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. Further, to evaluate the temporal irregularities (disorder/order) on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BOLD time series was decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and the wavelet entropy was calculated. Using a model time series consisting of multiple harmonics and nonstationary components, the wavelet entropy was compared with Shannon and spectral (Fourier-based) entropy. As an application, the wavelet entropy in 22 children with Rolandic epilepsy was compared to 22 age-matched healthy controls. The images were obtained by performing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a 3T system, an 8-element receive-only head coil, and an echo planar imaging pulse sequence ( T2*-weighted). The wavelet entropy was also compared to spectral entropy, regional homogeneity, and Shannon entropy.
RESULTS: Wavelet entropy was found to identify the nonstationary components of the model time series. In Rolandic epilepsy patients, a significantly elevated wavelet entropy was observed relative to controls for the whole cerebrum (P = 0.03). Spectral entropy (P = 0.41), regional homogeneity (P = 0.52), and Shannon entropy (P = 0.32) did not reveal significant differences.
CONCLUSION: The wavelet entropy measure appeared more sensitive to detect abnormalities in cerebral fluctuations represented by nonstationary effects in the BOLD time series than more conventional measures. This effect was observed in the model time series as well as in Rolandic epilepsy. These observations suggest that the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy exhibit stronger nonstationary temporal signal fluctuations than controls.

These more-advanced multiparametric MRI contrasts and the pertaining parameters are able to reveal abnormalities in type 2 diabetes, which may be related to cognitive decline. To further elucidate the nature of the link between diabetes, cognitive decline, and brain abnormalities, and changes over time thereof, biomarkers are needed which can be provided by advanced MRI techniques.

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the only biomedical imaging method that can noninvasively detect endogenous signals from the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain. Its increasing popularity has been aided by improvements in scanner hardware and acquisition methodology, as well as by broader access to pulse sequences that can selectively detect GABA, in particular J-difference spectral editing sequences. Nevertheless, implementations of GABA-edited MRS remain diverse across research sites, making comparisons between studies challenging. This large-scale multi-vendor, multi-site study seeks to better understand the factors that impact measurement outcomes of GABA-edited MRS. An international consortium of 24 research sites was formed. Data from 272 healthy adults were acquired on scanners from the three major MRI vendors and analyzed using the Gannet processing pipeline. MRS data were acquired in the medial parietal lobe with standard GABA+ and macromolecule- (MM-) suppressed GABA editing. The coefficient of variation across the entire cohort was 12\% for GABA+ measurements and 28\% for MM-suppressed GABA measurements. A multilevel analysis revealed that most of the variance (72\%) in the GABA+ data was accounted for by differences between participants within-site, while site-level differences accounted for comparatively more variance (20\%) than vendor-level differences (8\%). For MM-suppressed GABA data, the variance was distributed equally between site- (50\%) and participant-level (50\%) differences. The findings show that GABA+ measurements exhibit strong agreement when implemented with a standard protocol. There is, however, increased variability for MM-suppressed GABA measurements that is attributed in part to differences in site-to-site data acquisition. This study's protocol establishes a framework for future methodological standardization of GABA-edited MRS, while the results provide valuable benchmarks for the MRS community.},

The aim of this study was to noninvasively investigate 2 linked functional elements of the neurovascular unit, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow (CBF), in patients with early AD and healthy controls. Therefore, both dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging were applied to measure BBB permeability and CBF, respectively. The patients with early AD showed significantly lower CBF and local blood volume in the gray matter, compared with controls. In the patients, we also found that a reduction in CBF is correlated with an increase in leakage rate. This finding supports the hypothesis that neurovascular damage, and in particular impairment of the neurovascular unit constitutes the pathophysiological link between CBF reduction and BBB impairment in AD.},

The associations of neurotransmitters with type 2 diabetes and cognitive performance were examined using multivariate regression analyses controlling for age, sex, education, BMI, and percentage gray/white matter ratio in spectroscopic voxel.Analysis revealed higher GABA+ levels in participants with type 2 diabetes, in participants with higher fasting blood glucose levels and in participants with higher HbA1c levels, and higher GABA+ levels in participants with both high HbA1c levels and less cognitive performance.To conclude, participants with type 2 diabetes have alterations in the GABAergic neurotransmitter system, which are related to lower cognitive functioning, and hint at the involvement of an underlying metabolic mechanism.},

We examined whether cSVD and Aβ have independent or interactive effects on hippocampal volume (HV) in a memory clinic population. We included 87 individuals with clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 24), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 26), and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) (n = 37). cSVD magnetic resonance imaging markers included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, lacunar infarct presence, and microbleed presence. Aβ pathology was assessed as cerebrospinal fluid-derived Aβ1 - 42 levels and dichotomized into normal or abnormal, and HV was determined by manual volumetric measurements. A linear hierarchical regression approach was applied for the detection of additive or interaction effects between cSVD and Aβ on HV in the total participant group (n = 87) and in the non-demented group (including SCC and MCI individuals only, n = 63). The results revealed that abnormal Aβ and lacunar infarct presence were independently associated with lower HV in the non-demented individuals. Interestingly, Aβ and WMH pathology interacted in the non-demented individuals, such that WMH had a negative effect on HV in individuals with abnormal CSF Aβ42 levels, but not in individuals with normal CSF Aβ42 levels. These associations were not present when individuals with AD were included in the analyses. Our observations suggest that relatively early on in the disease process older individuals with abnormal Aβ levels are at an increased risk of accelerated disease progression when concomitant cSVD is present.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that alterations in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters might play a crucial role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) can provide valuable information about abnormal brain metabolism and neurotransmitter concentrations. However, few (1)H-MRS studies have been published on the imbalance of the two most abundant neurotransmitters in ASD: glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Moreover, to our knowledge none of these published studies is performed with a study population consisting purely of high-functioning autism (HFA) adolescents. Selecting only individuals with HFA eliminates factors possibly related to intellectual impairment instead of ASD. This study aims to assess Glu and GABA neurotransmitter concentrations in HFA. Occipital concentrations of Glu and GABA plus macromolecules (GABA+) were obtained using (1)H-MRS relative to creatine (Cr) in adolescents with HFA (n=15 and n=13 respectively) and a healthy control group (n=17). Multiple linear regression revealed significantly higher Glu/Cr and lower GABA+/Glu concentrations in the HFA group compared to the controls.

	abstract = {Purpose To investigate whether the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leaks blood-circulating substances in patients with early forms of Alzheimer disease (AD), and if so, to examine the extent and pattern of leakage. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the local medical ethical committees of the Maastricht University Medical Center and Leiden University Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. For this pilot study, 16 patients with early AD and 17 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence with dual time resolution for 25 minutes. The Patlak graphical approach was used to quantify the BBB leakage rate and local blood plasma volume. Subsequent histogram analysis was used to determine the volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue. Differences were assessed with linear regression analysis, adjusted for confounding variables. Results The BBB leakage rate was significantly higher in patients compared with that in control subjects in the total gray matter (P {\textless} .05) and cortex (P = .03). Patients had a significantly higher volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue in the gray matter (P = .004), normal-appearing white matter (P {\textless} .04), deep gray matter (P = .01), and cortex (P = .004). When all subjects were considered, scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination decreased significantly with increasing leakage in the deep gray matter (P = .007) and cortex (P {\textless} .05). Conclusion The results of this study showed global BBB leakage in patients with early AD that is associated with cognitive decline. A compromised BBB may be part of a cascade of pathologic events that eventually lead to cognitive decline and dementia. (©)RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of epilepsy cannot be reliably made prior to a patient's second seizure in most cases. Therefore, adequate diagnostic tools are needed to differentiate subjects with a first seizure from those with a seizure preceding the onset of epilepsy. The objective was to explore spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in subjects with a first-ever seizure and patients with new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and to find characteristic biomarkers for seizure recurrence after the first seizure.
METHODS: We examined 17 first-seizure subjects, 19 patients with new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and 18 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical investigation and received electroencephalography and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The BOLD time series were analyzed in terms of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs).
RESULTS: We found significantly stronger amplitudes (higher fALFFs) in patients with NOE relative to first-seizure subjects and healthy controls. The frequency range of 73-198 mHz (slow-3 subband) appeared most useful for discriminating patients with NOE from first-seizure subjects. The ReHo measure did not show any significant differences.
SIGNIFICANCE: The fALFF appears to be a noninvasive measure that characterizes spontaneous BOLD fluctuations and shows stronger amplitudes in the slow-3 subband of patients with NOE relative first-seizure subjects and healthy controls. A larger study population with follow-up is required to determine whether fALFF holds promise as a potential biomarker for identifying subjects at increased risk to develop epilepsy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability has been shown to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease and it may provide an early functional marker of progression or treatment effects. The aim of the study was to investigate the test-retest reproducibility and influencing factors of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in measuring subtle leakage in patients with cerebrovascular disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: DCE-MRI (3T) was performed on two separate days in 16 patients (age 66 ± 9 years) with cerebrovascular disease, prospectively. The leakage rate was quantified for white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) using the Patlak graphical approach with individual vascular input functions (VIFs). Furthermore, the influence of session-averaged VIFs, the average of the VIFs obtained on two days, and shorter scan times (range 5-25 minutes) on the reproducibility were evaluated in WM and GM.
RESULTS: Coefficients of variation (CV) ≤14.4\% (WM and GM), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.77 (WM) and 0.49 (GM), were observed for the leakage rate. Session-averaged VIFs hardly affected these results (CV ≤13.4\%). The repeatability coefficients (RCs) of the leakage rate decreased from 2.7·10(-3) to 0.4·10(-3) min(-1) in WM (P {\textless} 0.01) and 4.4·10(-3) to 0.9·10(-3) min(-1) in GM (P {\textless} 0.01) with increasing scan time (range 5-25 minutes).
CONCLUSION: Based on the moderate CVs and moderate-to-excellent ICCs, we demonstrate that measuring subtle BBB leakage using DCE-MRI is moderate-to-excellent reproducible. Longer scan times improve the reproducibility. The provided RCs at various scan times may assist future clinical studies investigating BBB leakage using DCE-MRI.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with cognitive impairment. This may be because of decreased microstructural integrity and microvascular perfusion, but data on these relationships are scarce. We determined the relationship between cognition and microvascular perfusion and microstructural integrity in SVD patients, using intravoxel incoherent motion imaging-a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging technique designed to determine microvascular perfusion and microstructural integrity simultaneously.
METHODS: Seventy-three patients with SVD and 39 controls underwent intravoxel incoherent motion imaging and neuropsychological assessment. Parenchymal diffusivity D (a surrogate measure of microstructural integrity) and perfusion-related measure fD* were calculated for the normal appearing white matter, white matter hyperintensities, and cortical gray matter. The associations between cognitive performance and D and fD* were determined.
RESULTS: In SVD patients, multivariable analysis showed that lower fD* in the normal appearing white matter and cortical gray matter was associated with lower overall cognition (P=0.03 and P=0.002, respectively), lower executive function (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively), and lower information-processing speed (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively). D was not associated with cognitive function. In controls, no association was found between D, fD*, and cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: In SVD patients, lower cognitive performance is associated with lower microvascular perfusion in the normal appearing white matter and cortical gray matter. Our results support recent findings that both cortical gray matter and normal appearing white matter perfusion may play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in SVD.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI can be used to measure blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. In neurodegenerative disorders such as small vessel disease and dementia, the leakage can be very subtle and the corresponding signal can be rather noisy. For these reasons, an optimized DCE-MRI measurement and study design is required. To this end, a new measure indicative of the spatial extent of leakage is introduced and the effects of scan time and sample size are explored.
METHODS: Dual-time resolution DCE-MRI was performed in 16 patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 17 healthy controls. The leakage rate (Ki ) and volume fraction of detectable leaking tissue (vL ) to quantify the spatial extent of BBB leakage were calculated in cortical gray matter and white matter using noise-corrected histogram analysis of leakage maps. Computer simulations utilizing realistic Ki histograms, mimicking the strong effect of noise and variation in Ki values, were performed to understand the influence of scan time on the estimated leakage.
RESULTS: The mean Ki was very low (order of 10(-4) min(-1) ) and highly influenced by noise, causing the Ki to be increasingly overestimated at shorter scan times. In the white matter, the Ki was not different between patients with early AD and controls, but was higher in the cortex for patients, reaching significance after 14.5 min of scan time. To detect group differences, vL proved more suitable, showing significantly higher values for patients compared with controls in the cortex after 8 minutes of scan time, and in white matter after 15.5 min.
CONCLUSIONS: Several ways to improve the sensitivity of a DCE-MRI experiment to subtle BBB leakage were presented. We have provided vL as an attractive and potentially more time-efficient alternative to detect group differences in subtle and widespread blood-brain barrier leakage compared with leakage rate Ki . Recommendations on group size and scan time are made based on statistical power calculations to aid future research.},

We assessed whether extravasation of gadolinium chelate could be visualized on delayed postcontrast FLAIR images in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four individuals participated in this study (15 with Alzheimer disease, 33 with mild cognitive impairment, and 26 with normal cognition). We assessed the appearance of pericortical enhancement after contrast administration, MR imaging markers of cerebrovascular damage, and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Three participants who were positive for pericortical enhancement (1 with normal cognition and 2 with mild cognitive impairment) were followed up for approximately 2 years. In vitro experiments with a range of gadolinium concentrations served to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the postcontrast FLAIR signals.
RESULTS: Postcontrast pericortical enhancement was observed in 21 participants (28\%), including 6 individuals with Alzheimer disease (40\%), 10 with mild cognitive impairment (30\%), and 5 with normal cognition (19\%). Pericortical enhancement was positively associated with age (P {\textless} .02) and ischemic stroke (P {\textless} .05), but not with cognitive status (P = .3). Foci with enhanced signal remained stable across time in all follow-up cases. The in vitro measurements confirmed that FLAIR imaging is highly sensitive for the detection of low gadolinium concentrations in CSF, but not in cerebral tissue.
CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast pericortical enhancement on FLAIR images occurs in older individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. It may represent chronic focal superficial BBB leakage. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine its clinical significance.},

The Computerized Visual Searching Task was used to measure central information processing speed, a common cognitive side effect of AED treatment.
RESULTS: Central information processing speed was lower in patients taking AEDs from the intermediate and high risk categories, compared with patients from the low risk category. The effect of risk category on global efficiency was significant (P {\textless} 0.05, ANCOVA), with a significantly higher global efficiency for patient from the low category compared with the high risk category (P {\textless} 0.05, post-hoc test). Risk category had no significant effect on the clustering coefficient (ANCOVA, P {\textgreater} 0.2). Also no significant associations between information processing speed and global efficiency or the clustering coefficient (linear regression analysis, P {\textgreater} 0.15) were observed.
CONCLUSION: Only the four patients taking topiramate show aberrant network measures, suggesting that alterations in functional brain network organization may be only subtle and measureable in patients with more severe cognitive side effects.},
