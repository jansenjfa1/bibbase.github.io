   Abstract = {Working memory is a temporary storage system under attentional control. It is believed to play a central role in online processing of complex cognitive information and may also play a role in social cognition and interpersonal interactions. Adolescents with a disorder on the autism spectrum display problems in precisely these domains. Social impairments, communication difficulties, and repetitive interests and activities are core domains of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and executive function problems are often seen throughout the spectrum. As the main cognitive theories of ASD, including the theory of mind deficit hypotheses, weak central coherence account, and the executive dysfunction theory, still fail to explain the broad spectrum of symptoms, a new perspective on the etiology of ASD is needed. Deficits in working memory are central to many theories of psychopathology, and are generally linked to frontal-lobe dysfunction. This article will review neuropsychological and (functional) brain imaging studies on working memory in adolescents with ASD. Although still disputed, it is concluded that within the working memory system specific problems of spatial working memory are often seen in adolescents with ASD. These problems increase when information is more complex and greater demands on working memory are made. Neuroimaging studies indicate a more global working memory processing or connectivity deficiency, rather than a focused deficit in the prefrontal cortex. More research is needed to relate these working memory difficulties and neuroimaging results in ASD to the behavioral difficulties as seen in individuals with a disorder on the autism spectrum.},

   Abstract = {AIM: People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically have deficits in the working memory (WM) system. WM is found to be an essential chain in successfully navigating in the social world. We hypothesize that brain networks for WM have an altered network integrity in ASD compared to controls. METHODS: Thirteen adolescents (one female) with autistic disorder (n = 1), Asperger's disorder (n = 7), or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (n = 5), and 13 typically developing healthy control adolescents (one female) participated in this study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using an n-back task and in resting state. RESULTS: The analysis of the behavioral data revealed deficits in WM performance in ASD, but only when tested to the limit. Adolescents with ASD showed lower binary global efficiency in the WM network than the healthy control group with n-back and resting-state data. This correlated with diagnostic scores for total problems, reciprocity, and language. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with higher-functioning autism have difficulty with the WM system, which is typically compensated. Functional MRI markers of brain network organization in ASD are related to characteristics of autism as represented in diagnostic scores. Therefore, functional MRI provides neuronal correlates for memory difficulties in adolescents with ASD.},

   Abstract = {Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly characterized by functional and communication impairments as well as restrictive and repetitive behavior. The leading hypothesis for the neural basis of autism postulates globally abnormal brain connectivity, which can be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Even in the absence of a task, the brain exhibits a high degree of functional connectivity, known as intrinsic, or resting-state, connectivity. Global default connectivity in individuals with autism versus controls is not well characterized, especially for a high-functioning young population. The aim of this study is to test whether high-functioning adolescents with ASD (HFA) have an abnormal resting-state functional connectivity. Materials and Methods: We performed spatial and temporal analyses on resting-state networks (RSNs) in 13 HFA adolescents and 13 IQ- and age-matched controls. For the spatial analysis, we used probabilistic independent component analysis (ICA) and a permutation statistical method to reveal the RSN differences between the groups. For the temporal analysis, we applied Granger causality to find differences in temporal neurodynamics. Results: Controls and HFA display very similar patterns and strengths of resting-state connectivity. We do not find any significant differences between HFA adolescents and controls in the spatial resting-state connectivity. However, in the temporal dynamics of this connectivity, we did find differences in the causal effect properties of RSNs originating in temporal and prefrontal cortices. Conclusion: The results show a difference between HFA and controls in the temporal neurodynamics from the ventral attention network to the salience-executive network: a pathway involving cognitive, executive, and emotion-related cortices. We hypothesized that this weaker dynamic pathway is due to a subtle trigger challenging the cognitive state prior to the resting state.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a congenital malformation of cortical development that often leads to medically refractory epilepsy. Focal resection can be an effective treatment, but is challenging as the surgically relevant abnormality may exceed the MR-visible lesion. The aim of the current study is to develop methodology to characterize the profile of functional connectivity around FCDs using resting-state functional MRI and in the individual patient. The detection of aberrant connectivity may provide a means to more completely delineate the clinically relevant lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen FCD patients (age, mean+/-SD: 31+/-11 years; 11 males) and 16 matched healthy controls (35+/-9 years; 7 males) underwent structural and functional imaging at 3 Tesla. The cortical surface was reconstructed from the T1-weighted scan and the registered functional MRI data was spatially normalized to a common anatomical standard space employing the gyral pattern. Seed-based functional connectivity was determined in all subjects for all dysplasia locations. A single patient was excluded based on an aberrant FCD seed time series. Functional connectivity as a function of geodesic distance (along the cortical surface) was compared between the individual patients and the homotopic normative connectivity profiles derived from the controls. RESULTS: In 12/14 patients, aberrant profiles of functional connectivity were found, which demonstrated both hyper- and hypoconnectivity as well as combinations. Abnormal functional connectivity was typically found (also) beyond the lesion visible on structural MRI, while functional connectivity profiles not related to a lesion appeared normal in patients. CONCLUSION: This novel functional MRI technique has potential for delineating functionally aberrant from normal cortex beyond the structural lesion in FCD, which remains to be confirmed in future research.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The reproducibility of tractography is important to determine its sensitivity to pathological abnormalities. The reproducibility of tract morphology has not yet been systematically studied and the recently developed tractography contrast Tract Density Imaging (TDI) has not yet been assessed at the tract specific level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) tractography are performed twice in 9 healthy subjects. Tractography is based on common space seed and target regions and performed for several major white matter tracts. Tractograms are converted to tract segmentations and inter-session reproducibility of tract morphology is assessed using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The coefficient of variation (COV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) are calculated of the following tract metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), volume, and TDI. Analyses are performed both for proximal (deep white matter) and extended (including subcortical white matter) tract segmentations. RESULTS: Proximal DSC values were 0.70-0.92. DSC values were 5-10% lower in extended compared to proximal segmentations. COV/ICC values of FA, ADC, volume and TDI were 1-4%/0.65-0.94, 2-4%/0.62-0.94, 3-22%/0.53-0.96 and 8-31%/0.48-0.70, respectively, with the lower COV and higher ICC values found in the proximal segmentations. CONCLUSION: For all investigated metrics, reproducibility depended on the segmented tract. FA and ADC had relatively low COV and relatively high ICC, indicating clinical potential. Volume had higher COV but its moderate to high ICC values in most tracts still suggest subject-differentiating power. Tract TDI had high COV and relatively low ICC, which reflects unfavorable reproducibility.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is a childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, that is increasingly associated with language impairment. In this study, we tested for a white matter (connectivity) correlate, employing diffusion weighted MRI and language testing. METHODS: Twenty-three children with RE and 23 matched controls (age: 8-14 years) underwent structural (T1-weighted) and diffusion-weighted MRI (b = 1200 s/mm(2), 66 gradient directions) at 3T, as well as neuropsychological language testing. Combining tractography and a cortical segmentation derived from the T1-scan, the rolandic tract were reconstructed (pre- and postcentral gyri), and tract fractional anisotropy (FA) values were compared between patients and controls. Aberrant tracts were tested for correlations with language performance. RESULTS: Several reductions of tract FA were found in patients compared to controls, mostly in the left hemisphere; the most significant effects involved the left inferior frontal (p = 0.005) and supramarginal (p = 0.004) gyrus. In the patient group, lower tract FA values were correlated with lower language performance, among others for the connection between the left postcentral and inferior frontal gyrus (p = 0.043, R = 0.43). CONCLUSION: In RE, structural connectivity is reduced for several connections involving the rolandic regions, from which the epileptiform activity originates. Most of these aberrant tracts involve the left (typically language mediating) hemisphere, notably the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) and the supramarginal gyrus (Wernicke's area). For the former, reduced language performance for lower tract FA was found in the patients. These findings provide a first microstructural white matter correlate for language impairment in RE.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) manifests during a critical phase of brain development, and has been associated with language impairments. Concordant abnormalities in structural and functional connectivity (SC and FC) have been described before. As SC and FC are under mutual influence, the current study investigates abnormalities in the SC-FC synergy in RE. METHODS: Twenty-two children with RE (age, mean +/- SD: 11.3 +/- 2.0 y) and 22 healthy controls (age 10.5 +/- 1.6 y) underwent structural, diffusion weighted, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T. The probabilistic anatomical landmarks atlas was used to parcellate the (sub)cortical gray matter. Constrained spherical deconvolution tractography and correlation of time series were used to assess SC and FC, respectively. The SC-FC correlation was assessed as a function of age for the non-zero structural connections over a range of sparsity values (0.01-0.75). A modularity analysis was performed on the mean SC network of the controls to localize potential global effects to subnetworks. SC and FC were also assessed separately using graph analysis. RESULTS: The SC-FC correlation was significantly reduced in children with RE compared to healthy controls, especially for the youngest participants. This effect was most pronounced in a left and a right centro-temporal network, as well as in a medial parietal network. Graph analysis revealed no prominent abnormalities in SC or FC network organization. CONCLUSION: Since SC and FC converge during normal maturation, our finding of reduced SC-FC correlation illustrates impaired synergy between brain structure and function. More specifically, since this effect was most pronounced in the youngest participants, RE may represent a developmental disorder of delayed brain network maturation. The observed effects seem especially attributable to medial parietal connections, which forms an intermediate between bilateral centro-temporal modules of epileptiform activity, and bear relevance for language function.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Over the last years, evidence has accumulated that rolandic epilepsy (RE) is associated with serious cognitive comorbidities, including language impairment. However, the cerebral mechanism through which epileptiform activity in the rolandic (sensorimotor) areas may affect the language system is unknown. To investigate this, the connectivity between rolandic areas and regions involved in language processing is studied using functional MRI (fMRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: fMRI data was acquired from 22 children with rolandic epilepsy and 22 age-matched controls (age range: 8-14 years), both at rest and using word-generation and reading tasks. Activation map analysis revealed no group differences (FWE-corrected, p < 0.05) and was therefore used to define regions of interest for pooled (patients and controls combined) language activation. Independent component analysis with dual regression was used to identify the sensorimotor resting-state network in all subjects. The associated functional connectivity maps were compared between groups at the regions of interest for language activation identified from the task data. In addition, neuropsychological language testing (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 4th edition) was performed. RESULTS: Functional connectivity with the sensorimotor network was reduced in patients compared to controls (p = 0.011) in the left inferior frontal gyrus, i.e. Broca's area as identified by the word-generation task. No aberrant functional connectivity values were found in the other regions of interest, nor were any associations found between functional connectivity and language performance. Neuropsychological testing confirmed language impairment in patients relative to controls (reductions in core language score, p = 0.03; language content index, p = 0.01; receptive language index, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Reduced functional connectivity was demonstrated between the sensorimotor network and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) in children with RE, which might link epileptiform activity/seizures originating from the sensorimotor cortex to language impairment, and is in line with the identified neuropsychological profile of anterior language dysfunction.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is an idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy with a well-established neuropsychological profile of language impairment. The aim of this study is to provide a functional correlate that links rolandic (sensorimotor) pathology to language problems using functional MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three children with RE (8-14 years old) and 21 matched controls underwent extensive language assessment (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals). fMRI was performed at rest and using word generation, reading, and finger tapping paradigms. Since no activation group differences were found, regions of interest (ROIs) were defined at pooled (patients and controls combined) activation maxima and in contralateral homotopic cortex, and used to assess language lateralization as well as for a resting-state connectivity analysis. Furthermore, the association between connection strength and language performance was investigated. RESULTS: Reduced language performance was found in the children with RE. Bilateral activation was found for both language tasks with some predominance of the left hemisphere in both groups. Compared to controls, patient connectivity was decreased between the left sensorimotor area and right inferior frontal gyrus (p<0.01). For this connection, lower connectivity was associated with lower language scores in the patient group (r=0.49, p=0.02), but not in the controls. CONCLUSION: Language laterality analysis revealed bilateral language representation in the age range under study (8-14 years). As a consequence, the connection of reduced functional connectivity we found represents an impaired interplay between motor and language networks, and aberrant functional connectivity associated with poorer language performance. These findings provide a first neuronal correlate in terms of aberrant resting-state functional connectivity for language impairment in RE.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment is frequent in children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), but its etiology is unknown. With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have explored the relationship between brain activation, functional connectivity, and cognitive functioning in a cohort of pediatric patients with FLE and healthy controls. METHODS: Thirty-two children aged 8-13 years with FLE of unknown cause and 41 healthy age-matched controls underwent neuropsychological assessment and structural and functional brain MRI. We investigated to which extent brain regions activated in response to a working memory task and assessed functional connectivity between distant brain regions. Data of patients were compared to controls, and patients were grouped as cognitively impaired or unimpaired. KEY FINDINGS: Children with FLE showed a global decrease in functional brain connectivity compared to healthy controls, whereas brain activation patterns in children with FLE remained relatively intact. Children with FLE complicated by cognitive impairment typically showed a decrease in frontal lobe connectivity. This decreased frontal lobe connectivity comprised both connections within the frontal lobe as well as connections from the frontal lobe to the parietal lobe, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. SIGNIFICANCE: Decreased functional frontal lobe connectivity is associated with cognitive impairment in pediatric FLE. The importance of impairment of functional integrity within the frontal lobe network, as well as its connections to distant areas, provides new insights in the etiology of the broad-range cognitive impairments in children with FLE.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment is frequent in children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Its etiology remains unknown. With diffusion tensor imaging, we have studied cerebral white matter properties and associations with cognitive functioning in children with FLE and healthy controls. METHODS: Thirty children aged 8-13 years with FLE of unknown cause and 39 healthy age-matched controls underwent neuropsychological assessment, structural and diffusion-weighted brain MRI. Patients were grouped as cognitively impaired or unimpaired, and their white matter diffusion properties were compared with the controls. RESULTS: Children with FLE had reduced apparent diffusion coefficients in various posteriorly located tract bundles, a reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of the white matter tract between the right frontal and right occipital lobe, and smaller volumes of several collections of interlobar bundle tracts, compared with controls. The cognitively impaired patient group demonstrated significant increases in FA of the white matter of both occipital lobes, a reduced FA of white matter tract bundles between the right frontal and both left occipital lobe and subcortical white matter area, and smaller volumes of two collections of tract bundles connecting the frontal lobe with the temporal and parietal lobes, compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Children with FLE had white matter abnormalities mainly in posterior brain regions, not confined to the area of the seizure focus. Cognitively impaired children with FLE showed the most pronounced white matter abnormalities. These possibly reflect disturbed maturation and might be part of the etiology of the cognitive impairment.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment is frequent in children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), but its aetiology is unknown. MRI scans often reveal no structural brain abnormalities that could explain the cognitive impairment. This does not exclude more subtle morphological abnormalities that can only be detected by automated morphometric techniques. AIMS: With these techniques, we investigate the relationship between cortical brain morphology and cognitive functioning in a cohort of children with FLE and healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four children aged 8-13 years with FLE of unknown cause and 41 healthy age-matched controls underwent neuropsychological assessment and structural brain MRI. Patients were grouped as cognitively impaired or unimpaired. Intracranial volume, white matter volume, lobular cortical volume, cortical thickness and volumes of cortex structures were compared between patients and controls, and potential correlations with cognitive status were determined. RESULTS: The group of cognitively impaired children with FLE had significantly smaller left temporal cortex volumes, specifically middle temporal grey matter volume and entorhinal cortex thickness. In addition, cognitively impaired children with FLE had smaller volumes of structures in the left and right frontal cortex, right temporal cortex and the left subcortical area. CONCLUSION: Cognitively impaired children with FLE have smaller volumes of various cortex structures within the frontal lobes and in extra-frontal regions, most notably temporal cortex volumes. These findings might well explain the broad scale of cognitive domains affected in children with FLE complicated by cognitive impairment and highlight that FLE impacts on areas beyond the frontal lobe.},

   Abstract = {Cognitive impairment is the most common comorbidity in children with epilepsy, but its pathophysiology and predisposing conditions remain unknown. Clinical epilepsy characteristics are not conclusive in determining cognitive outcome. Because many children with epilepsy do not have macrostructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, the underlying substrate for cognitive impairment may be found at the microstructural or functional level. In the last two decades, new MRI techniques have been developed that have the potential to visualize microstructural or functional abnormalities associated with cognitive impairment. These include volumetric MRI, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI). All of these techniques have shed new light on various aspects associated with, or underlying, cognitive impairment, although their use in epilepsy has been limited and focused mostly on adults. Therefore, in this review, the use of all these different MRI techniques to unravel cognitive impairment in epilepsy is discussed both in adults and children with epilepsy. Volumetric MRI and VBM have revealed significant volume losses in the area of the seizure focus as well as in distant areas. DTI adds evidence of loss of integrity of connections from the seizure focus to distant areas as well as between distant areas. MRS and fMRI have shown impaired function both in the area of the seizure focus as well as in distant structures. For this review we have compiled and compared findings from the various techniques to conclude that cognitive impairment in epilepsy results from a network disorder in which the (micro)structures as well as the functionality can be disturbed.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate if single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SV-MRS) can help in lateralising and sometimes in localizing an epileptogenic focus. The assumption is that in MRI negative patients the underlying pathology most often is focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Several studies have shown that in the presence of FCD there are also (1)H-MRS abnormalities on the contralateral side. However, in most cases the studied group was not homogeneous and included different forms of dysplasias, including band heterotopias and polymicrogyria, and the studies used different spectroscopy protocols. In the present study, using bilateral SV-MRS we investigated the presence of a lateralisation index in two groups of patients with localisation related epilepsy: patients with focal cortical dysplasia on MRI and patients without MRI abnormalities with a focus identified by MEG. Aim of the study was to show that in both groups the expected epileptogenic side shows more pronounced metabolic alterations, making MRS a possible screening tool for clarifying lateralisation questions in patients with cryptogenic localisation related epilepsy. METHODS: In ten patients a single voxel was placed over the FCD and in nine patients over the region of interest (ROI) as indicated by MEG. In all patients a voxel was also placed in the contralateral homologus location. We used metabolite concentrations as peak ratios relative to the creatine (Cr) peak to calculate a lateralisation index. RESULTS: In both groups NAA/Cr was significantly lower on the affected side whereas the results for Cho/Cr were more diverse. There were no significant differences between the two groups. The limitations of the used methods and the implications of the findings are discussed.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although ethosuximide is one of the oldest antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), little information is available about the cognitive side effects of ethosuximide. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive profile of ethosuximide. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used an extensive neuropsychological test battery in patients with epilepsy aged 6-16 years who were treated with monotherapy ethosuximide. We evaluated the efficacy of the drug by seizure frequency (seizure free or not). RESULTS: We included 61 patients with a mean age of 9.4 years [standard deviation (SD) 2.7] who used on average 686 mg/day (SD 245) ESM as monotherapy. ESM was effective in the majority of the patients (70 % were seizure free for at least 6 months at moment of inclusion). The total study population showed impairments of intelligence, visuomotor, and attentional function including activation/alertness. Comparisons between the well-controlled patients and patients who were not in remission showed significantly lower intelligence values and lower performance on the visual-perceptual and attentional tasks for the group with ongoing seizures. Our results suggested that the higher order cognitive dysfunctions (such as intelligence and visual-perceptual functions) may be regarded as seizure or aetiology effects and that the impaired fluid cognitive functions, such as activation/alertness, sustained auditory attention and attentional control or switching, were due to ESM. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the attentional dysfunction resulting in psychomotor slowing and alertness deficits may be regarded as effects of ethosuximide. Although no untreated baseline assessment was available, these effects are comparable to those of other AEDs, and ethosuximide may therefore be considered an AED with only mild effects on cognition. As ethosuximide is a first-line therapy for absence seizures in childhood, and drug-induced cognitive impairment may interfere with development, learning, and academic achievement, these findings are of interest to clinicians who prescribe this drug, especially when informing parents.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lacosamide (LCM) is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) with potential benefit as adjunctive treatment in patients with partial-onset seizures. As yet, limited information on cognitive effects of LCM is available, especially in real-life settings. AIMS: In this open clinical prospective study, the cognitive effects of LCM were evaluated when used as adjunctive antiepileptic therapy in patients with refractory epilepsy. METHODS: We included 33 patients aged between 16 and 74 years (mean: 37 years). All patients had a localization-related epilepsy. Patients were assessed at baseline before starting LCM treatment and during follow-up when the optimal clinical dose was achieved. MATERIALS: Subjective complaints were evaluated using the SIDAED; effects on cognition were evaluated using the computerized visual searching task (CVST). RESULTS: The CVST showed significant faster information processing reaction times at the second evaluation (P = 0.013), which was not correlated with seizure control, type of epilepsy, age, gender, drug load, number of concomitant drugs, dose or duration of LCM treatment. On the SIDAED, patients complained more about their cognitive function at the second evaluation (P = 0.005). For the SIDAED, a positive correlation at follow-up was found between the total severity score and higher age (r = 0.375, P = 0.031), but not with epilepsy factors or treatment characteristics. DISCUSSION/CONLUSION: Screening of the cognitive effects of LCM showed that LCM does not have negative effects on information processing speed. As this is the most sensitive function for cognitive side effects of AEDs, LCM does not seem to induce the common negative cognitive effects. Remarkably, patients complained more, especially about their cognitive function, which is possible the 'doing better, feeling worse phenomenon'.},

   Abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that alterations in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters might play a crucial role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) can provide valuable information about abnormal brain metabolism and neurotransmitter concentrations. However, few (1)H-MRS studies have been published on the imbalance of the two most abundant neurotransmitters in ASD: glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Moreover, to our knowledge none of these published studies is performed with a study population consisting purely of high-functioning autism (HFA) adolescents. Selecting only individuals with HFA eliminates factors possibly related to intellectual impairment instead of ASD. This study aims to assess Glu and GABA neurotransmitter concentrations in HFA. Occipital concentrations of Glu and GABA plus macromolecules (GABA+) were obtained using (1)H-MRS relative to creatine (Cr) in adolescents with HFA (n=15 and n=13 respectively) and a healthy control group (n=17). Multiple linear regression revealed significantly higher Glu/Cr and lower GABA+/Glu concentrations in the HFA group compared to the controls. These results imply that imbalanced neurotransmitter levels of excitation and inhibition are associated with HFA in adolescents.},

   Abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition often co-exist in (prodromal) dementia, and both types of pathology have been associated with neurodegeneration. We examined whether cSVD and Abeta have independent or interactive effects on hippocampal volume (HV) in a memory clinic population. We included 87 individuals with clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 24), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 26), and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) (n = 37). cSVD magnetic resonance imaging markers included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, lacunar infarct presence, and microbleed presence. Abeta pathology was assessed as cerebrospinal fluid-derived Abeta1 - 42 levels and dichotomized into normal or abnormal, and HV was determined by manual volumetric measurements. A linear hierarchical regression approach was applied for the detection of additive or interaction effects between cSVD and Abeta on HV in the total participant group (n = 87) and in the non-demented group (including SCC and MCI individuals only, n = 63). The results revealed that abnormal Abeta and lacunar infarct presence were independently associated with lower HV in the non-demented individuals. Interestingly, Abeta and WMH pathology interacted in the non-demented individuals, such that WMH had a negative effect on HV in individuals with abnormal CSF Abeta42 levels, but not in individuals with normal CSF Abeta42 levels. These associations were not present when individuals with AD were included in the analyses. Our observations suggest that relatively early on in the disease process older individuals with abnormal Abeta levels are at an increased risk of accelerated disease progression when concomitant cSVD is present.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Breakdown of BBB integrity occurs in dementia and may lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We assessed whether extravasation of gadolinium chelate could be visualized on delayed postcontrast FLAIR images in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four individuals participated in this study (15 with Alzheimer disease, 33 with mild cognitive impairment, and 26 with normal cognition). We assessed the appearance of pericortical enhancement after contrast administration, MR imaging markers of cerebrovascular damage, and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Three participants who were positive for pericortical enhancement (1 with normal cognition and 2 with mild cognitive impairment) were followed up for approximately 2 years. In vitro experiments with a range of gadolinium concentrations served to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the postcontrast FLAIR signals. RESULTS: Postcontrast pericortical enhancement was observed in 21 participants (28%), including 6 individuals with Alzheimer disease (40%), 10 with mild cognitive impairment (30%), and 5 with normal cognition (19%). Pericortical enhancement was positively associated with age (P < .02) and ischemic stroke (P < .05), but not with cognitive status (P = .3). Foci with enhanced signal remained stable across time in all follow-up cases. The in vitro measurements confirmed that FLAIR imaging is highly sensitive for the detection of low gadolinium concentrations in CSF, but not in cerebral tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast pericortical enhancement on FLAIR images occurs in older individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. It may represent chronic focal superficial BBB leakage. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine its clinical significance.},

   Abstract = {In many brain diseases it can be qualitatively observed that spatial patterns in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation maps appear more (diffusively) distributed than in healthy controls. However, measures that can quantitatively characterize this spatial distributiveness in individual subjects are lacking. In this study, we propose a number of spatial heterogeneity measures to characterize brain activation maps. The proposed methods focus on different aspects of heterogeneity, including the shape (compactness), complexity in the distribution of activated regions (fractal dimension and co-occurrence matrix), and gappiness between activated regions (lacunarity). To this end, functional MRI derived activation maps of a language and a motor task were obtained in language impaired children with (Rolandic) epilepsy and compared to age-matched healthy controls. Group analysis of the activation maps revealed no significant differences between patients and controls for both tasks. However, for the language task the activation maps in patients appeared more heterogeneous than in controls. Lacunarity was the best measure to discriminate activation patterns of patients from controls (sensitivity 74%, specificity 70%) and illustrates the increased irregularity of gaps between activated regions in patients. The combination of heterogeneity measures and a support vector machine approach yielded further increase in sensitivity and specificity to 78% and 80%, respectively. This illustrates that activation distributions in impaired brains can be complex and more heterogeneous than in normal brains and cannot be captured fully by a single quantity. In conclusion, heterogeneity analysis has potential to robustly characterize the increased distributiveness of brain activation in individual patients.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Focal cortical dysplasia is a common cause of intractable epilepsy for which neurosurgery is an option. Delineations of a focal cortical dysplasia lesion on structural brain images may not necessarily reflect the functional borders of normal tissue. Our objective was to determine whether abnormalities in spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations arise in focal cortical dysplasia lesions and proximal regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with focal cortical dysplasia-related epilepsy and 16 healthy controls underwent structural and resting-state functional MR imaging. Three known blood oxygen level-dependent measures were determined, including the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and wavelet entropy. These measures were evaluated in the lesion and perilesional zone and normalized to the contralateral cortex of patients with focal cortical dysplasia and healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients showed significantly decreased fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and increased wavelet entropy in the focal cortical dysplasia lesion and the perilesional zone (</=2 cm) relative to the contralateral homotopic cortex and the same regions in healthy controls. Regional homogeneity was significantly increased in the focal cortical dysplasia lesion compared with the contralateral homotopic cortex and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations were seen up to 2 cm distant from the radiologically visible boundary. It was demonstrated that functional boundaries go beyond structural boundaries of focal cortical dysplasia lesions. Validation is required to reveal whether this information is valuable for surgical planning and outcome evaluation of focal cortical dysplasia lesions and comparing current results with electrophysiologic analysis.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the wavelet entropy for the characterization of intrinsic aberrant temporal irregularities in the time series of resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. Further, to evaluate the temporal irregularities (disorder/order) on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BOLD time series was decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and the wavelet entropy was calculated. Using a model time series consisting of multiple harmonics and nonstationary components, the wavelet entropy was compared with Shannon and spectral (Fourier-based) entropy. As an application, the wavelet entropy in 22 children with Rolandic epilepsy was compared to 22 age-matched healthy controls. The images were obtained by performing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a 3T system, an 8-element receive-only head coil, and an echo planar imaging pulse sequence ( T2*-weighted). The wavelet entropy was also compared to spectral entropy, regional homogeneity, and Shannon entropy. RESULTS: Wavelet entropy was found to identify the nonstationary components of the model time series. In Rolandic epilepsy patients, a significantly elevated wavelet entropy was observed relative to controls for the whole cerebrum (P = 0.03). Spectral entropy (P = 0.41), regional homogeneity (P = 0.52), and Shannon entropy (P = 0.32) did not reveal significant differences. CONCLUSION: The wavelet entropy measure appeared more sensitive to detect abnormalities in cerebral fluctuations represented by nonstationary effects in the BOLD time series than more conventional measures. This effect was observed in the model time series as well as in Rolandic epilepsy. These observations suggest that the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy exhibit stronger nonstationary temporal signal fluctuations than controls.

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of epilepsy cannot be reliably made prior to a patient's second seizure in most cases. Therefore, adequate diagnostic tools are needed to differentiate subjects with a first seizure from those with a seizure preceding the onset of epilepsy. The objective was to explore spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in subjects with a first-ever seizure and patients with new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and to find characteristic biomarkers for seizure recurrence after the first seizure. METHODS: We examined 17 first-seizure subjects, 19 patients with new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and 18 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical investigation and received electroencephalography and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The BOLD time series were analyzed in terms of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs). RESULTS: We found significantly stronger amplitudes (higher fALFFs) in patients with NOE relative to first-seizure subjects and healthy controls. The frequency range of 73-198 mHz (slow-3 subband) appeared most useful for discriminating patients with NOE from first-seizure subjects. The ReHo measure did not show any significant differences. SIGNIFICANCE: The fALFF appears to be a noninvasive measure that characterizes spontaneous BOLD fluctuations and shows stronger amplitudes in the slow-3 subband of patients with NOE relative first-seizure subjects and healthy controls. A larger study population with follow-up is required to determine whether fALFF holds promise as a potential biomarker for identifying subjects at increased risk to develop epilepsy.},

   Abstract = {One of the most common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, the A to G transition at base pair 3243, has been linked to changes in the brain, in addition to commonly observed hearing problems, diabetes and myopathy. However, a detailed quantitative description of m.3243A>G patients' brains has not been provided so far. In this study, ultra-high field MRI at 7T and volume- and surface-based data analyses approaches were used to highlight morphology (i.e. atrophy)-, microstructure (i.e. myelin and iron concentration)- and metabolism (i.e. cerebral blood flow)-related differences between patients (N=22) and healthy controls (N=15). The use of quantitative MRI at 7T allowed us to detect subtle changes of biophysical processes in the brain with high accuracy and sensitivity, in addition to typically assessed lesions and atrophy. Furthermore, the effect of m.3243A>G mutation load in blood and urine epithelial cells on these MRI measures was assessed within the patient population and revealed that blood levels were most indicative of the brain's state and disease severity, based on MRI as well as on neuropsychological data. Morphometry MRI data showed a wide-spread reduction of cortical, subcortical and cerebellar gray matter volume, in addition to significantly enlarged ventricles. Moreover, surface-based analyses revealed brain area-specific changes in cortical thickness (e.g. of the auditory cortex), and in T1, T2* and cerebral blood flow as a function of mutation load, which can be linked to typically m.3243A>G-related clinical symptoms (e.g. hearing impairment). In addition, several regions linked to attentional control (e.g. middle frontal gyrus), the sensorimotor network (e.g. banks of central sulcus) and the default mode network (e.g. precuneus) were characterized by alterations in cortical thickness, T1, T2* and/or cerebral blood flow, which has not been described in previous MRI studies. Finally, several hypotheses, based either on vascular, metabolic or astroglial implications of the m.3243A>G mutation, are discussed that potentially explain the underlying pathobiology. To conclude, this is the first 7T and also the largest MRI study on this patient population that provides macroscopic brain correlates of the m.3243A>G mutation indicating potential MRI biomarkers of mitochondrial diseases and might guide future (longitudinal) studies to extensively track neuropathological and clinical changes.},

Compared with a control epilepsy group, in the topiramate-treated group, there was significantly less activation in the language-mediating regions of the prefrontal cortex; the topiramate group also had significantly lower neuropsychological language scores.

   Abstract = {Hydrogen 1 (1H) magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy enables noninvasive in vivo quantification of metabolite concentrations in the brain. Currently, metabolite concentrations are most often presented as ratios (eg, relative to creatine) rather than as absolute concentrations. Despite the success of this approach, it has recently been suggested that relative quantification may introduce substantial errors and can lead to misinterpretation of spectral data and to erroneous metabolite values. The present review discusses relevant methods to obtain absolute metabolite concentrations with a clinical MR system by using single-voxel spectroscopy or chemical shift imaging. Important methodological aspects in an absolute quantification strategy are addressed, including radiofrequency coil properties, calibration procedures, spectral fitting methods, cerebrospinal fluid content correction, macromolecule suppression, and spectral editing. Techniques to obtain absolute concentrations are now available and can be successfully applied in clinical practice. Although the present review is focused on 1H MR spectroscopy of the brain, a large part of the methodology described can be applied to other tissues as well.},

   Abstract = {The aim of the present study is to correlate non-invasive, pretreatment biological imaging (dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI [DCE-MRI] and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy [(1)H-MRS]) findings with specific molecular marker data in neck nodal metastases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Pretreatment DCE-MRI and (1)H-MRS were performed on neck nodal metastases of 12 patients who underwent surgery. Surgical specimens were analyzed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays for: Ki-67 (reflecting cellular proliferation), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (the "endogenous marker" of tumor vessel growth), carbonic anhydrase (CAIX), hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha), and human papillomavirus (HPV). Additionally, necrosis was estimated based on H&E staining. The Spearman correlation was used to compare DCE-MRI, (1)H-MRS, and molecular marker data. A significant correlation was observed between DCE-MRI parameter std(k(ep)) and VEGF IHC expression level (rho=0.81, p=0.0001). Furthermore, IHC expression levels of Ki-67 inversely correlated with std(K(trans)) and std(v(e)) (rho=-0.71; p=0.004, and rho=-0.73; p=0.003, respectively). Other DCE-MRI, (1)H-MRS and IHC values did not show significant correlation. The results of this preliminary study indicate that the level of heterogeneity of perfusion in metastatic HNSCC seems positively correlated with angiogenesis, and inversely correlated with proliferation. These results are preliminary in nature and are indicative, and not definitive, trends portrayed in HNSCC patients with nodal disease. Future studies with larger patient populations need to be carried out to validate and clarify our preliminary findings.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The reproducibility of quantitative cerebral T2 relaxometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and H magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic imaging was assessed on a clinical 3.0 T MR system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeated measurements in 10 healthy volunteers were used to establish the reproducibility of quantitative measures derived from different quantitative MR techniques, namely the T2 relaxation time, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the fractional anisotropy (FA), and metabolite concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), and myo-inositol (mI). Results were compared with previously reported reproducibility measures from 1.5 T. RESULTS: The coefficient of variation (CV) was < or =1.6% for T2, < or =1.6% for ADC, and < or =5.3%, for FA in the cerebrum. For metabolites the CV was < or =8.0% in the frontal lobe and < or =20.4% in the temporal lobe. CONCLUSIONS: The reproducibility of quantitative brain MRI at 3.0 T is better than or at least comparable to the reproducibility at 1.5 T.},

Quantitative multimodal MRI was applied 24 h and 8 weeks later, in rats with FS and age-matched controls, and comprised hippocampal volumetry and proton spectroscopy, and cerebral T2 relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). At 9 weeks histology was performed. Hippocampal T2 relaxation time elevations appeared to be transient. DTI abnormalities detected in the amygdala persisted up to 8 weeks. Hippocampal volumes were not affected. Histology showed increased fiber density and anisotropy in the hippocampus, and reduced neuronal surface area in the amygdala. Quantitative serial MRI is able to detect transient, and most importantly, long-term FS-induced changes that reflect microstructural alterations.},

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 19 HNSCC patients underwent pre- and intra-treatment DCE-MRI scans at a 1.5T MRI scanner. All patients had chemo-radiation treatment. Pharmacokinetic modeling was performed on the acquired DCE-MRI images, generating maps of volume transfer rate (K(trans)) and volume fraction of the extravascular extracellular space (ve). Image texture analysis was then employed on maps of K(trans) and ve, generating two texture measures: Energy (E) and homogeneity. RESULTS: No significant changes were found for the mean and standard deviation for K(trans) and ve between pre- and intra-treatment (P > 0.09). Texture analysis revealed that the imaging biomarker E of ve was significantly higher in intra-treatment scans, relative to pretreatment scans (P < 0.04). CONCLUSION: Chemo-radiation treatment in HNSCC significantly reduces the heterogeneity of tumors.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: To correlate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and (18)F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG PET) of nodal metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for assessment of tumor biology. Additionally, pretreatment multimodality imaging was evaluated for its efficacy in predicting short-term response to treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Metastatic neck nodes were imaged with (1)H-MRS, DCE-MRI, and [(18)F]FDG PET in 16 patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC, before treatment. Short-term patient radiological response was evaluated at 3 to 4 months. Correlations among (1)H-MRS (choline concentration relative to water [Cho/W]), DCE-MRI (volume transfer constant [K(trans)]; volume fraction of the extravascular extracellular space [v(e)]; and redistribution rate constant [k(ep)]), and [(18)F]FDG PET (standard uptake value [SUV] and total lesion glycolysis [TLG]) were calculated using nonparametric Spearman rank correlation. To predict short-term responses, logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was found between Cho/W and TLG (rho = 0.599; p = 0.031). Cho/W correlated negatively with heterogeneity measures of standard deviation std(v(e)) (rho = -0.691; p = 0.004) and std(k(ep)) (rho = -0.704; p = 0.003). Maximum SUV (SUVmax) values correlated strongly with MRI tumor volume (rho = 0.643; p = 0.007). Logistic regression indicated that std(K(trans)) and SUVmean were significant predictors of short-term response (p < 0.07). CONCLUSION: Pretreatment multimodality imaging using (1)H-MRS, DCE-MRI, and [(18)F]FDG PET is feasible in HNSCC patients with nodal metastases. Additionally, combined DCE-MRI and [(18)F]FDG PET parameters were predictive of short-term response to treatment.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess noninvasively the tumor microenvironment of neck nodal metastases in patients with head-and-neck cancer by investigating the relationship between tumor perfusion measured using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and hypoxia measured by (18)F-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO) positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen newly diagnosed head-and-neck cancer patients with metastatic neck nodes underwent DCE-MRI and (18)F-FMISO PET imaging before chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The matched regions of interests from both modalities were analyzed. To examine the correlations between DCE-MRI parameters and standard uptake value (SUV) measurements from (18)F-FMISO PET, the nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated. Furthermore, DCE-MRI parameters were compared between nodes with (18)F-FMISO uptake and nodes with no (18)F-FMISO uptake using Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: For the 13 patients, a total of 18 nodes were analyzed. The nodal size strongly correlated with the (18)F-FMISO SUV (rho = 0.74, p < 0.001). There was a strong negative correlation between the median k(ep) (redistribution rate constant) value (rho = -0.58, p = 0.042) and the (18)F-FMISO SUV. Hypoxic nodes (moderate to severe (18)F-FMISO uptake) had significantly lower median K(trans) (volume transfer constant) (p = 0.049) and median k(ep) (p = 0.027) values than did nonhypoxic nodes (no (18)F-FMISO uptake). CONCLUSION: This initial evaluation of the preliminary results support the hypothesis that in metastatic neck lymph nodes, hypoxic nodes are poorly perfused (i.e., have significantly lower K(trans) and k(ep) values) compared with nonhypoxic nodes.},

   Abstract = {The classification of embryonic and adult stem cells, including their derivatives, is still limited, and often these cells are best defined by their functional properties. Recent gene array studies have yielded contradictory results. Also, very little is known about the metabolic properties of these exciting cells. In this study, proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy was used to identify the major low-molecular-weight metabolites in murine embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their neural stem cell (NSC) derivatives. ESC are characterized by an unusually low number of NMR-detectable metabolites, high phosphocholine (PC) content, and nondetectable glycerophosphocholine (GPC). The metabolic profiles of NSC resemble glial cells and oligodendrocyte progenitors, but with considerably higher PC, GPC, and myo-inositol content. The results suggest that NMR spectroscopy in vitro can provide markers to study the effects of differentiation on cell metabolism, and potentially to assess stem cell preparations for differentiation status.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Water in biological structures often displays non-Gaussian diffusion behavior. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of non-Gaussian fitting by using the kurtosis model of the signal intensity decay curves obtained from DWI by using an extended range of b-values in studies of phantoms and HNSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with HNSCC underwent DWI by using 6 b-factors (0, 50-1500 s/mm(2)) at 1.5T. Monoexponential (yielding ADC(mono)) and non-Gaussian kurtosis (yielding apparent diffusion coefficient D(app) and apparent kurtosis coefficient K(app)) fits were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis in selected regions of interest (primary tumors, metastatic lymph nodes, and spinal cord). DWI studies were also performed on phantoms containing either water or homogenized asparagus. To determine whether the kurtosis model provided a significantly better fit than did the monoexponential model, an F test was performed. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess correlations between K(app) and D(app). RESULTS: The kurtosis model fit the experimental data points significantly better than did the monoexponential model (P < .05). D(app) was approximately twice the value of ADC(mono) (eg, in neck nodal metastases D(app) was 1.54 and ADC(mono) was 0.84). K(app) showed a weak Spearman correlation with D(app) in a homogenized asparagus phantom and for 44% of tumor lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The use of kurtosis modeling to fit DWI data acquired by using an extended b-value range in HNSCC is feasible and yields a significantly better fit of the data than does monoexponential modeling. It also provides an additional parameter, K(app), potentially with added value.},

   Abstract = {We investigated whether type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and the presence of cognitive impairment are associated with altered cerebral blood flow (CBF). Forty-one participants with and thirty-nine without T2DM underwent 3-Tesla MRI, including a quantitative technique measuring (macrovascular) blood flow in the internal carotid artery and an arterial spin labeling technique measuring (microvascular) perfusion in the grey matter (GM). Three analysis methods were used to quantify the CBF: a region of interest analysis, a voxel-based statistical parametric mapping technique, and a 'distributed deviating voxels' method. Participants with T2DM exhibited significantly more tissue with low CBF values in the cerebral cortex and the subcortical GM (3.8-fold increase). The latter was the only region where the hypoperfusion remained after correcting for atrophy, indicating that the effect of T2DM on CBF, independent of atrophy, is small. Subcortical CBF was associated with depression. No associations were observed for CBF in other regions with diabetes status, for carotid blood flow with diabetes status, or for CBF or flow in relation with cognitive function. To conclude, a novel method that tallies total 'distributed deviating voxels' demonstrates T2DM-associated hypoperfusion in the subcortical GM, not associated with cognitive performance. Whether a vascular mechanism underlies cognitive decrements remains inconclusive.},

   Abstract = {For patients with chronic cryptogenic localisation-related epilepsy (CLRE), conventional MRI does not provide measures to discern between patients with or without cognitive complaints. We investigated, in a preliminary study, whether it is possible to detect cerebral biomarkers of cognitive impairment in patients with CLRE using sensitive quantitative MRI techniques. Neuropsychological assessment and quantitative 3.0 T MRI, comprising T2 relaxometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and spectroscopic imaging, were applied to 35 patients with CLRE and 21 healthy controls. Analysis included the left and right hippocampi, and frontal and temporal lobes. Differences between the groups and correlations with cognitive and clinical characteristics were assessed. Patients with epilepsy scored significantly worse on cognitive tasks compared to healthy controls. Significantly larger CSF fractions in the hippocampi and left temporal lobe, a longer T2 relaxation time in the left hippocampus, and a significantly higher concentration of glutamate/glutamine in the left frontal lobe were observed in patients with epilepsy. Moreover, poor memory performance was significantly correlated with larger CSF fractions in the right hippocampus and left temporal lobe in patients. In the temporal lobe, an association between subtle changes in morphology (indicative of atrophy) and memory performance was found, consistent with previous literature. These results may help to explain the alterations in brain functioning in patients with epilepsy.},

   Abstract = {Objectives - The use of telencephalin as a possible marker for altered cortical function as demonstrated by functional MRI was investigated in a pilot study with 16 patients with localization-related epilepsy and secondarily generalized seizures. Materials and methods - Functional MRI of verbal working memory performance (Sternberg paradigm) and self-regulatory control processes (Stroop paradigm) was used to examine cortical activation in 16 patients with localization-related epilepsy and secondarily generalized seizures. Additionally, blood serum concentrations of soluble telencephalin (marker for neuronal damage) were determined. Results - In three patients (one temporal and two frontal focus), telencephalin was detected. All three patients had lower functional MRI activation in the frontotemporal region (P = 0.04), but not in other regions (P > 0.35) compared with patients without detectable telencephalin. Additionally, an association of levetiracetam and frontotemporal activation was observed. Conclusions - These preliminary data in a heterogeneous group suggest an association between decreased frontotemporal activation on fMRI and both detectable telencephalin serum levels and levetiracetam use. Future longitudinal studies with larger patient groups are required to confirm these observations. It is hypothesized that altered local function of the frontotemporal cortex in localization-related epilepsy might be better predicted by the biochemical marker telencephalin than epilepsy characteristics such as seizure focus.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: White matter lesions (WML) have been proven to be associated with cognitive impairment. As (1) the decline of cognitive function is the most frequent comorbid disorder in epilepsy, and (2) patients with epilepsy have a relatively high prevalence of WML, the question is raised whether WML in patients with epilepsy are also associated with cognitive decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed at 3.0 T, comprising T1-weighted, T2 relaxometry, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Patients with localization-related epilepsy with impaired and unimpaired cognitive functioning and a healthy control group were included. Furthermore, the performance of an automated WML detection algorithm, based on regional intensity evaluation, was assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of WML, detected on 3.0 T FLAIR images, is 63% in healthy volunteers and 46% in patients with localization-related, cryptogenic epilepsy. No relationship between WML volume and cognitive performance was observed. The WML volumes from the automated segmentation method were found to be significantly correlated to the volumes obtained by neuroradiologic assessment. CONCLUSIONS: No relations could be found between WML and cognition in the well-defined population of patients with epilepsy. Other clinical characteristics of chronic epilepsy, such as seizures, age of onset, and medication are more likely to play an important role in cognitive decline. Furthermore, the automated WML detection algorithm using a regional Z-score analysis can successfully segment and quantify the WML on FLAIR images.},

   Abstract = {Patients with chronic epilepsy, who have suffered a high number of secondarily generalized tonicclonic seizures (SGTCS) frequently show cognitive comorbidity. It is yet unclear whether a higher
number of SGTCS is associated with tissue changes in the brain. We have investigated in patients with chronic epilepsy whether a high number of SGTCS accumulated over life is associated with
microstructural changes in brain tissue. Sixteen patients with localization-related epilepsy with SGTCS underwent a multimodal quantitative Magnetic Resonance (MR) examination at 1.5 T,
comprising T2 relaxometry, and diffusion weighted imaging to study microstructural changes in the temporal and frontal lobes. Fourteen healthy volunteers were also included to assess the
effect of age. Patients with more than 20 SGTCS (n=8) showed a significantly lower IQ (-20%, p<0.05) compared to those with less than 20 SGTCS (n=8). Furthermore, regional combined
multimodal analysis revealed that significant quantitative MRI changes, related to the number of SGTCS, were present in the frontal lobe but not in the temporal lobe. Moreover, the left and right
frontal lobe generally displayed lower T2 relaxation times, smaller pericortical cerebrospinal fluid fraction and lower apparent diffusion coefficients, in the patients with more than 20 SGTCS.
These findings suggest that SGTCS are associated with substantial changes in microstructural brain tissue characteristics within the frontal lobes. These frontal changes possibly explain the
cognitive problems which are often observed in patients with many SGTCS. This knowledge may help in the development of treatment aimed at preventing decline in cognitive abilities.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although volumetry of the hippocampus is considered to be an established technique, protocols reported in literature are not described in great detail. This article provides a complete and detailed protocol for hippocampal volumetry applicable to T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired at 3 Tesla, which has become the standard for structural brain research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protocol encompasses T1-weighted image acquisition at 3 Tesla, anatomic guidelines for manual hippocampus delineation, requirements of delineation software, reliability measures, and criteria to assess and ensure sufficient reliability. Moreover, the validity of the correction for total intracranial volume size was critically assessed. The protocol was applied by 2 readers to the MR images of 36 patients with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy, 4 patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis, and 20 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The uncorrected hippocampal volumes were 2923 +/- 500 mm3 (mean +/- SD) (left) and 3120 +/- 416 mm3 (right) for the patient group and 3185 +/- 411 mm3 (left) and 3302 +/- 411 mm3 (right) for the healthy control group. The volume of the 4 pathologic hippocampi of the patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis was 2980 +/- 422 mm3. The inter-reader reliability values were determined: intraclass-correlation-coefficient (ICC) = 0.87 (left) and 0.86 (right), percentage volume difference (VD) = 7.0 +/- 4.7% (left) and 6.0 +/- 3.8% (right), and overlap ratio (OR) = 0.82 +/- 0.04 (left) and 0.82 +/- 0.03 (right). The positive Pearson correlation between hippocampal volume and total intracranial volume was found to be low: r = 0.48 (P = 0.03, left) and r = 0.62 (P = 0.004, right) and did not significantly reduce the volumetric variances, showing the limited benefit of the brain size correction. CONCLUSIONS: A protocol was described to determine hippocampal volumes based on 3 Tesla MR images with high inter-reader reliability. Although the reliability of hippocampal volumetry at 3 Tesla was similar to the literature values obtained at 1.5 Tesla, hippocampal border definition is argued to be more confident and easier because of the improved signal-to-noise characteristics.},

   Abstract = {In the context of neuroimaging experiments, it is essential to account for the multiple comparisons problem when thresholding statistical mappings. Various methods are in use to deal with this issue, but they differ in their signal detection power for small- and large-scale effects. In this paper, we comprehensively describe a new method that is based on control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature of neuroimaging effects. This is achieved by using a sliding window technique, in which FDR-control is first applied at a regional level. Thus, a new statistical map that is related to the regionally achieved FDR is derived from the available voxelwise P-values. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholding based on this map is demonstrated to have better discriminatory power than conventional thresholding based on P-values. Secondly, it is shown that the resulting maps can be thresholded at a level that results in control of the global FDR. By means of statistical arguments and numerical simulations under widely varying conditions, our method is validated, characterized, and compared to some other common voxel-based methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional FDR-control). It is found that our method shows considerably higher sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control, while still controlling the achieved FDR at the same level or better. Finally, our method is applied to two diverse neuroimaging experiments to assess its practical merits, resulting in substantial improvements as compared to the other methods.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: To extend the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) model to restricted diffusion and to simultaneously quantify the perfusion and restricted diffusion parameters in neck nodal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The non-gaussian (NG)-IVIM model was developed and tested on diffusion-weighted MRI data collected on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner from eight patients with head and neck cancer. Voxel-wise parameter quantification was performed by using a noise-rectified least-square fitting method. The NG-IVIM, IVIM, Kurtosis, and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) models were used for comparison. For each voxel, within the metastatic node, the optimal model was determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The voxel percentage preferred by each model was calculated and the optimal model map was generated. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision dependency of the new model. RESULTS: For the eight neck nodes, the range of voxel percentage preferred by the NG-IVIM model was 2.3-79.3%. The optimal modal maps showed heterogeneities within the tumors. The Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the accuracy and precision of the NG-IVIM model improved by increasing signal-to-noise ratio and b value. CONCLUSION: The NG-IVIM model characterizes perfusion and restricted diffusion simultaneously in neck nodal metastases.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging for investigating differences between primary head and neck tumors and nodal metastases and to evaluate IVIM efficacy in predicting outcome. METHODS: Sixteen patients with head and neck cancer underwent IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging on a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The significance of parametric difference between primary tumors and metastatic nodes were tested. Probabilities of progression-free survival and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In comparison with metastatic nodes, the primary tumors had significantly higher vascular volume fraction (f) (P < 0.0009) and lower diffusion coefficient (D) (P < 0.0002). Patients with lower SD for D had prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment IVIM measures were feasible in investigating the physiologic differences between the 2 tumor tissues. After appropriate validation, these findings might be useful in optimizing treatment planning and improving patient care.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess whether an artificial neural network (ANN) model is a useful tool for automatic detection of cancerous voxels in the prostate from (1)H-MRSI datasets and whether the addition of information about anatomical segmentation improves the detection of cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Institutional Review Board approved this HIPAA-compliant study and waived informed consent. Eighteen men with prostate cancer (median age, 55 years; range, 36-71 years) who underwent endorectal MRI/MRSI before radical prostatectomy were included in this study. These patients had at least one cancer area on whole-mount histopathological map and at least one matching MRSI voxel suspicious for cancer detected. Two ANN models for automatic classification of MRSI voxels in the prostate were implemented and compared: model 1, which used only spectra as input, and model 2, which used the spectra plus information from anatomical segmentation. The models were trained, tested and validated using spectra from voxels that the spectroscopist had designated as cancer and that were verified on histopathological maps. RESULTS: At ROC analysis, model 2 (AUC = 0.968) provided significantly better (P = 0.03) classification of cancerous voxels than did model 1 (AUC = 0.949). CONCLUSION: Automatic analysis of prostate MRSI to detect cancer using ANN model is feasible. Application of anatomical segmentation from MRI as an additional input to ANN improves the accuracy of detecting cancerous voxels from MRSI.},

   Abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the only biomedical imaging method that can noninvasively detect endogenous signals from the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain. Its increasing popularity has been aided by improvements in scanner hardware and acquisition methodology, as well as by broader access to pulse sequences that can selectively detect GABA, in particular J-difference spectral editing sequences. Nevertheless, implementations of GABA-edited MRS remain diverse across research sites, making comparisons between studies challenging. This large-scale multi-vendor, multi-site study seeks to better understand the factors that impact measurement outcomes of GABA-edited MRS. An international consortium of 24 research sites was formed. Data from 272 healthy adults were acquired on scanners from the three major MRI vendors and analyzed using the Gannet processing pipeline. MRS data were acquired in the medial parietal lobe with standard GABA+ and macromolecule- (MM-) suppressed GABA editing. The coefficient of variation across the entire cohort was 12% for GABA+ measurements and 28% for MM-suppressed GABA measurements. A multilevel analysis revealed that most of the variance (72%) in the GABA+ data was accounted for by differences between participants within-site, while site-level differences accounted for comparatively more variance (20%) than vendor-level differences (8%). For MM-suppressed GABA data, the variance was distributed equally between site- (50%) and participant-level (50%) differences. The findings show that GABA+ measurements exhibit strong agreement when implemented with a standard protocol. There is, however, increased variability for MM-suppressed GABA measurements that is attributed in part to differences in site-to-site data acquisition. This study's protocol establishes a framework for future methodological standardization of GABA-edited MRS, while the results provide valuable benchmarks for the MRS community.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An association between impaired school performance and rolandic epilepsy is frequently reported. Language outcome, in particular, seems to be affected, although rolandic epilepsy originates from the motor-sensory cortex. In this study we tried to find a correlation between locomotion problems and language impairment. METHODS: In this noncontrolled, open, clinical cohort study of 48 children with rolandic epilepsy, a 24-hour EEG and a neuropsychological assessment were obtained for all children. RESULTS: Children with rolandic epilepsy had a significant delay in reading skills (reading words: mean=6 months, SD=11.9, P<0.002; reading sentences: mean=8.6 months, SD=12.7, P<0.001), compared with the healthy population. There was a significant correlation between problems in motor development and delays in reading skills (reading words: r=-0.426, P=0.006; reading sentences: r=-0.343, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Reading performance is impaired in children with rolandic epilepsy. Reading of sentences is more impaired than reading of words. There is a significant correlation between problems in motor development and language, suggesting their interaction at the level of the cortex.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy, a childhood epilepsy associated with language impairments, was investigated for language-related cortical abnormalities. METHODS: Twenty-four children with rolandic epilepsy and 24 controls (age 8-14 years) were recruited and underwent the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals test. Structural MRI was performed at 3 T (voxel size 1 x 1 x 1 mm(3)) for fully automated quantitative assessment of cortical thickness. Regression analysis was used to test for differences between patients and controls and to assess the effect of age and language indices on cortical thickness. RESULTS: For patients the core language score (mean +/- SD: 92 +/- 18) was lower than for controls (106 +/- 11, p = 0.0026) and below the norm of 100 +/- 15 (p = 0.047). Patients showed specific impairments in receptive language index (87 +/- 19, p = 0.002) and language content index (87 +/- 18, p = 0.0016). Cortical thickness was reduced in patients (p < 0.05, multiple-comparisons corrected) in left perisylvian regions. Furthermore, extensive cortical thinning with age was found in predominantly left-lateralized frontal, centro-parietal and temporal regions. No associations were found between cortical thickness and language indices in the regions of aberrant cortex. CONCLUSION: The cortical abnormalities described represent subtle but significant pathomorphology in this critical phase of brain development (8-14 years) and suggest that rolandic epilepsy should not be considered merely a benign condition. Future studies employing longitudinal designs are prompted for further investigations into cerebral abnormalities in RE and associations with cognitive impairment and development.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, Rolandic epilepsy is in many cases associated with developmental language impairment. However, from the literature it is unclear exactly which domains are affected; A wide variety of investigations are reported that each provide a different representation of language performance in these patients. AIMS: The aim of this study is to compare performance on the language domains between children with Rolandic epilepsy and healthy controls. METHODS: Prospective study of children with Rolandic epilepsy compared to healthy controls. 25 children (mean age 136.6 months, SD 23.0) with Rolandic epilepsy and 25 age-matched healthy controls were tested on their language function using the CELF-4 (Clinical evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Dutch edition). The healthy control were not matched regard to other important factors, particularly educational attainment and co-morbidity. Expressive language, receptive language, language content, language structure and language working memory were tested. RESULTS: In children with Rolandic epilepsy, the core language score was significant lower compared with healthy controls. They scored specifically lower on the receptive language index and language content index (both p = 0.002). A trend towards decreased expressive language index was observed (p = 0.054). Language structure and language working memory were in the normal range. CONCLUSION: Language was found to be impaired in children with typical Rolandic epilepsy. Especially semantic language processing including receptive language and language content was significantly impaired. The common denominator of these functions is semantic language processing.},

   Abstract = {Characterization of flow properties in cerebral arteries with 1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI is usually limited to large cerebral arteries and difficult to evaluate in the small perforating arteries due to insufficient spatial resolution. In this study, we assessed the feasibility to measure blood flow waveforms in the small lenticulostriate arteries with 7 Tesla velocity-sensitive MRI. The middle cerebral artery was included as reference. Imaging was performed in five young and five old healthy volunteers. Flow was calculated by integrating time-varying velocity values over the vascular cross-section. MRI acquisitions were performed twice in each subject to determine reproducibility. From the flow waveforms, the pulsatility index and damping factor were deduced. Reproducibility values, in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficients, were found to be good to excellent. Measured pulsatility index of the lenticulostriate arteries significantly increased and damping factor significantly decreased with age. In conclusion, we demonstrate that blood flow through the lenticostriate arteries can be precisely measured using 7 Tesla MRI and reveal effects of arterial stiffness due to aging. These findings hold promise to provide relevant insights into the pathologies involving perforating cerebral arteries.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) can provide information regarding tumor perfusion and permeability and has shown prognostic value in certain tumors types. The goal of this study was to assess the prognostic value of pretreatment DCE-MRI in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients with nodal disease undergoing chemoradiation therapy or surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-four patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma and neck nodal metastases were eligible for the study. Pretreatment DCE-MRI was performed on a 1.5T MRI. Clinical follow-up was a minimum of 12 months. DCE-MRI data were analyzed using the Tofts model. DCE-MRI parameters were related to treatment outcome (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]). Patients were grouped as no evidence of disease (NED), alive with disease (AWD), dead with disease (DOD), or dead of other causes (DOC). Prognostic significance was assessed using the log-rank test for single variables and Cox proportional hazards regression for combinations of variables. RESULTS: At last clinical follow-up, for Stage III, all 12 patients were NED. For Stage IV, 43 patients were NED, 4 were AWD, 11 were DOD, and 4 were DOC. K(trans) is volume transfer constant. In a stepwise Cox regression, skewness of K(trans) (volume transfer constant) was the strongest predictor for Stage IV patients (PFS and OS: p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that skewness of K(trans) was the strongest predictor of PFS and OS in Stage IV HNSCC patients with nodal disease. This study suggests an important role for pretreatment DCE-MRI parameter K(trans) as a predictor of outcome in these patients.},

   Abstract = {Sin3A or Sin3B are components of a corepressor complex that mediates repression by transcription factors such as the helix-loop-helix proteins Mad and Mxi. Members of the Mad/Mxi family of repressors play important roles in the transition between proliferation and differentiation by down-regulating the expression of genes that are activated by the proto-oncogene product Myc. Here, we report the solution structure of the second paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domain (PAH2) of Sin3B in complex with a peptide comprising the N-terminal region of Mad1. This complex exhibits a novel interaction fold for which we propose the name 'wedged helical bundle'. Four alpha-helices of PAH2 form a hydrophobic cleft that accommodates an amphipathic Mad1 alpha-helix. Our data further show that, upon binding Mad1, secondary structure elements of PAH2 are stabilized. The PAH2-Mad1 structure provides the basis for determining the principles of protein interaction and selectivity involving PAH domains.},

   Abstract = {Compared with conventional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is more prone to thermal noise and motion. Optimized sampling schemes have been proposed that reduce the propagation of noise. At 3 T, however, motion may play a more dominant role than noise. Although the effects of noise at 3 T are less compared with 1.5 T because of the higher signal-to-noise ratio, motion is independent of field strength and will persist. To improve the reliability of clinical DTI at 3 T, it is important to know to what extent noise and motion contribute to the uncertainties of the DTI indices. In this study, the effects of noise- and motion-related signal uncertainties are disentangled using in vivo measurements and computer simulations. For six clinically standard available sampling schemes, the reproducibility was assessed in vivo, with and without motion correction applied. Additionally, motion and noise simulations were performed to determine the relative contributions of motion and noise to the uncertainties of the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). It is shown that the contributions of noise and motion are of the same order of magnitude at 3 T. Similar to the propagation of noise, the propagation of motion-related signal perturbations is also influenced by the choice of sampling scheme. Sampling schemes with only six diffusion directions demonstrated a lower reproducibility compared with schemes with 15 and 32 directions and feature a positive bias for the FA in relatively isotropic tissue. Motion correction helps improving the precision and accuracy of DTI indices.},

   Abstract = {Many children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) have significant cognitive comorbidity, for which the underlying mechanism has not yet been unraveled, but is likely related to disturbed cerebral network integrity. Using resting-state fMRI, we investigated whether cerebral network characteristics are associated with epilepsy and cognitive comorbidity. We included 37 children with FLE and 41 healthy age-matched controls. Cognitive performance was determined by means of a computerized visual searching task. A connectivity matrix for 82 cortical and subcortical brain regions was generated for each subject by calculating the inter-regional correlation of the fMRI time signals. From the connectivity matrix, graph metrics were calculated and the anatomical configuration of aberrant connections and modular organization was investigated. Both patients and controls displayed efficiently organized networks. However, FLE patients displayed a higher modularity, implying that subnetworks are less interconnected. Impaired cognition was associated with higher modularity scores and abnormal modular organization of the brain, which was mainly expressed as a decrease in long-range and an increase in interhemispheric connectivity in patients. We showed that network modularity analysis provides a sensitive marker for cognitive impairment in FLE and suggest that abnormally interconnected functional subnetworks of the brain might underlie the cognitive problems in children with FLE.},

   Abstract = {Advances in computational network analysis have enabled the characterization of topological properties in large scale networks including the human brain. Information on structural networks in the brain can be obtained in-vivo by performing tractography on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. However, little is known about the reproducibility of network properties derived from whole brain tractography data, which has important consequences for minimally detectable abnormalities or changes over time. Moreover, acquisition parameters, such as the number of gradient directions and gradient strength, possibly influence network metrics and the corresponding reproducibility derived from tractography data. The aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to determine the effect of several clinically available DTI sampling schemes, differing in number of gradient directions and gradient amplitude, on small world metrics and (ii) to evaluate the interscan reproducibility of small world metrics. DTI experiments were conducted on six healthy volunteers scanned twice. Probabilistic tractography was performed to reconstruct structural connections between regions defined from an anatomical atlas. The observed reproducibility of the network measures was high, reflected by low values for the coefficient of variation (<3.8%), advocating the use of graph theoretical measurements to study neurological diseases. Small world metrics were dependent on the choice of DTI gradient scheme and showed stronger connectivity with increasing directional resolution. The interscan reproducibility was not dependent on the gradient scheme. These findings should be considered when comparing results across studies using different gradient schemes or designing new studies.},

   Abstract = {In childhood frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), cognitive impairment and educational underachievement are serious, well-known co-morbidities. The broad scale of affected cognitive domains suggests wide-spread network disturbances that not only involves, but also extends beyond the frontal lobe. In this study we have investigated whole brain connectional properties of children with FLE in relation to their cognitive impairment and compared them with healthy controls. Functional connectivity (FC) of the networks was derived from dynamic fluctuations of resting state fMRI and structural connectivity (SC) was obtained from fiber tractograms of diffusion weighted MRI. The whole brain network was characterized with graph theoretical metrics and decomposed into modules. Subsequently, the graph metrics and the connectivity within and between modules were related to cognitive performance. Functional network disturbances in FLE were related to increased clustering, increased path length, and stronger modularity compared to healthy controls, which was accompanied by stronger within- and weaker between-module functional connectivity. Although structural path length and clustering appeared normal in children with FLE, structural modularity increased with stronger cognitive impairment. It is concluded that decreased coupling between large-scale functional network modules is a hallmark for impaired cognition in childhood FLE.},

   Abstract = {Patients with chronic epilepsy frequently display cognitive comorbidity and might have widespread network abnormalities outside the epileptic zone, which might affect a variety of cognitive functions and global intelligence. We aimed to study the role of white matter connectivity in cognitive comorbidity. Thirty-nine patients with nonsymptomatic localization-related epilepsy and varying degrees of cognitive impairment and 23 age-matched healthy controls were included. Whole brain white matter networks were constructed from fiber tractography. Weighted graph theoretical analysis was performed to study white matter network abnormalities associated with epilepsy and cognition. Patients with severe cognitive impairment showed lower clustering (a measure of brain network segregation) and higher path length (a measure of brain network integration) compared with the healthy controls and patients with little or no cognitive impairment, whereas whole brain white matter volume did not differ. Correlation analyses revealed that IQ and cognitive impairment were strongly associated with clustering and path lengths. This study revealed impaired white matter connectivity, associated with cognitive comorbidity in patients with chronic epilepsy. As whole brain white matter volumes were preserved in the patient group, our results suggest an important role for the network topology rather than volumetric changes, in epilepsy with cognitive decline.},

   Abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with accelerated cognitive decline. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms still remain to be elucidated although it is known that insulin signaling modulates neurotransmitter activity, including inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and excitatory glutamate (Glu) receptors. Therefore, we examined whether levels of GABA and Glu are related to diabetes status and cognitive performance.Forty-one participants with type 2 diabetes and 39 participants without type 2 diabetes underwent detailed cognitive assessments and 3-Tesla proton MR spectroscopy. The associations of neurotransmitters with type 2 diabetes and cognitive performance were examined using multivariate regression analyses controlling for age, sex, education, BMI, and percentage gray/white matter ratio in spectroscopic voxel.Analysis revealed higher GABA+ levels in participants with type 2 diabetes, in participants with higher fasting blood glucose levels and in participants with higher HbA1c levels, and higher GABA+ levels in participants with both high HbA1c levels and less cognitive performance.To conclude, participants with type 2 diabetes have alterations in the GABAergic neurotransmitter system, which are related to lower cognitive functioning, and hint at the involvement of an underlying metabolic mechanism.},

Diffusion MRI was performed to assess microstructure (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) and white matter connectivity (tract volume) of the hippocampus, which were compared between participants with and without type 2 diabetes. No differences in hippocampal microstructure were observed. Participants with type 2 diabetes had fewer white matter connections between the hippocampus and frontal lobe (P = 0.017). Participants who scored lower on memory function, regardless of type 2 diabetes, had fewer white matter connections between the hippocampus and temporal lobe (P = 0.017). Taken together, type 2 diabetes and memory decrements appear to be associated with altered hippocampal white matter connectivity.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is associated with accelerated cognitive decline, especially regarding memory for which the hippocampus plays an essential role. The pathophysiological mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. The purpose of this study is to examine whether hippocampal microvascular and microstructural changes are related to type 2 diabetes (based on status or based on fasting blood glucose [FBG] levels) and verbal memory performance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-nine participants with type 2 diabetes (64.5 +/- 6.1 years old) and 34 participants without type 2 diabetes (58.3 +/- 9.2 years old) underwent detailed cognitive assessments and 3-Tesla MRI using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI. Multivariate regression analyses controlling for age, sex, education level, BMI, systolic blood pressure, hematocrit level, and relative hippocampal volume were performed to examine associations between hippocampal IVIM measures, type 2 diabetes (status and FBG), and memory performance. RESULTS: For the microvasculature, blood perfusion volume (f) was larger in participants with type 2 diabetes, f and blood flow (fD*) increased with higher FBG levels, and microvascular pseudodiffusion (D*) and fD*, which are indicative of altered microvasculature, were higher in participants with both relatively high FBG levels and low memory performance. In addition, fD* increased with lower memory performance. For the parenchymal microstructure, the diffusion (D), indicative of injured microstructure, was higher with reduced memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the parenchymal microstructure, especially the microvascular properties of the hippocampus are altered in participants with both type 2 diabetes and memory problems and possibly hint at an underlying vascular mechanism.},

   Abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive decrements, accelerated cognitive decline, and increased risk for dementia. Patients with the metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for diabetes, may display comparable cognitive decrements as seen in type 2 diabetes. Currently, the impact of diabetes and prediabetes on cognition and the underlying organization of functional brain networks still remain to be elucidated. This study investigated whether functional brain networks are affected in type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Forty-seven participants with diabetes, 47 participants with prediabetes, and 45 control participants underwent detailed cognitive testing and 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI. Graph theoretical network analysis was performed to investigate alterations in functional cerebral networks. Participants with diabetes displayed altered network measures, characterized by a higher normalized cluster coefficient and higher local efficiency, compared with control participants. The network measures of the participants with prediabetes fell between those with diabetes and control participants. Lower processing speed was associated with shorter path length and higher global efficiency. Participants with type 2 diabetes have altered functional brain networks. This alteration is already apparent in the prediabetic stage to a somewhat lower level, hinting at functional reorganization of the cerebral networks as a compensatory mechanism for cognitive decrements.},

The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in diabetes still remain to be elucidated. In addition to conventional images, MRI offers a versatile set of novel contrasts, including blood perfusion, neuronal function, white matter microstructure, and metabolic function. These more-advanced multiparametric MRI contrasts and the pertaining parameters are able to reveal abnormalities in type 2 diabetes, which may be related to cognitive decline. To further elucidate the nature of the link between diabetes, cognitive decline, and brain abnormalities, and changes over time thereof, biomarkers are needed which can be provided by advanced MRI techniques. This review summarizes to what extent MRI, especially advanced multiparametric techniques, can elucidate the underlying neuronal substrate that reflects the cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes.},

   Abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment may play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline and dementia. In vivo imaging studies are needed to quantify and localize the BBB defects during life, contemplating the circulatory properties. We reviewed the literature for imaging studies investigating BBB impairment in patients suffering from dementia. After selection, 11 imaging studies were included, of which 6 used contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2 used contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and 3 positron emission tomography (PET). Primarily the MRI studies hint at a subtle increasing permeability of the BBB, particularly in patients already exhibiting cerebrovascular pathology. More elaborate studies are required to provide convincing evidence on BBB impairment in patients with various stages of dementia with and without obvious cerebrovascular pathology. In the future, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI techniques and transport specific imaging using PET may further detail the research on the molecular nature of BBB defects.},

   Abstract = {Purpose To investigate whether the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leaks blood-circulating substances in patients with early forms of Alzheimer disease (AD), and if so, to examine the extent and pattern of leakage. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the local medical ethical committees of the Maastricht University Medical Center and Leiden University Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. For this pilot study, 16 patients with early AD and 17 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence with dual time resolution for 25 minutes. The Patlak graphical approach was used to quantify the BBB leakage rate and local blood plasma volume. Subsequent histogram analysis was used to determine the volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue. Differences were assessed with linear regression analysis, adjusted for confounding variables. Results The BBB leakage rate was significantly higher in patients compared with that in control subjects in the total gray matter (P < .05) and cortex (P = .03). Patients had a significantly higher volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue in the gray matter (P = .004), normal-appearing white matter (P < .04), deep gray matter (P = .01), and cortex (P = .004). When all subjects were considered, scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination decreased significantly with increasing leakage in the deep gray matter (P = .007) and cortex (P < .05). Conclusion The results of this study showed global BBB leakage in patients with early AD that is associated with cognitive decline. A compromised BBB may be part of a cascade of pathologic events that eventually lead to cognitive decline and dementia. ((c))RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI can be used to measure blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. In neurodegenerative disorders such as small vessel disease and dementia, the leakage can be very subtle and the corresponding signal can be rather noisy. For these reasons, an optimized DCE-MRI measurement and study design is required. To this end, a new measure indicative of the spatial extent of leakage is introduced and the effects of scan time and sample size are explored. METHODS: Dual-time resolution DCE-MRI was performed in 16 patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 17 healthy controls. The leakage rate (Ki ) and volume fraction of detectable leaking tissue (vL ) to quantify the spatial extent of BBB leakage were calculated in cortical gray matter and white matter using noise-corrected histogram analysis of leakage maps. Computer simulations utilizing realistic Ki histograms, mimicking the strong effect of noise and variation in Ki values, were performed to understand the influence of scan time on the estimated leakage. RESULTS: The mean Ki was very low (order of 10(-4) min(-1) ) and highly influenced by noise, causing the Ki to be increasingly overestimated at shorter scan times. In the white matter, the Ki was not different between patients with early AD and controls, but was higher in the cortex for patients, reaching significance after 14.5 min of scan time. To detect group differences, vL proved more suitable, showing significantly higher values for patients compared with controls in the cortex after 8 minutes of scan time, and in white matter after 15.5 min. CONCLUSIONS: Several ways to improve the sensitivity of a DCE-MRI experiment to subtle BBB leakage were presented. We have provided vL as an attractive and potentially more time-efficient alternative to detect group differences in subtle and widespread blood-brain barrier leakage compared with leakage rate Ki . Recommendations on group size and scan time are made based on statistical power calculations to aid future research.},

   Abstract = {The neurovascular unit, which protects neuronal cells and supplies them with essential molecules, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The aim of this study was to noninvasively investigate 2 linked functional elements of the neurovascular unit, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow (CBF), in patients with early AD and healthy controls. Therefore, both dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging were applied to measure BBB permeability and CBF, respectively. The patients with early AD showed significantly lower CBF and local blood volume in the gray matter, compared with controls. In the patients, we also found that a reduction in CBF is correlated with an increase in leakage rate. This finding supports the hypothesis that neurovascular damage, and in particular impairment of the neurovascular unit constitutes the pathophysiological link between CBF reduction and BBB impairment in AD.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive impairment is an important non-motor symptom heralding the development of dementia. Effective treatments to slow down the rate of cognitive decline in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment are lacking. Here, we describe the design of the Parkin'Play study, which assesses the effects of a cognitive health game intervention on cognition in PD. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a multicentre, phase-II, open-randomized clinical trial that aims to recruit 222 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment. Eligible patients have PD, Hoehn & Yahr stages I-III, are aged between 40 and 75 years, and have cognitive impairment but no dementia. The intervention group (n = 111) will be trained using a web-based health game targeting multiple cognitive domains. The control group (n = 111) will be placed on a waiting list. In order to increase compliance the health game adapts to the subjects' performance, is enjoyable, and can be played at home. From each group, 20 patients will undergo fMRI to test for potential functional brain changes underlying treatment. The primary outcome after 12 weeks of training is cognitive function, as assessed by a standard neuropsychological assessment battery and an online cognitive assessment. The neuropsychological assessment battery covers the following domains: executive function, memory, visual perception, visuoconstruction and language. A compound score for overall cognitive function will be calculated as the mean score of all test Z-scores based on the distribution of scores for both groups taken together. Secondary outcomes at follow-up visits up to 24 weeks include various motor and non-motor symptoms, compliance, and biological endpoints (fMRI). DISCUSSION: This study aims at evaluating whether a cognitive intervention among PD patients leads to an increased cognitive performance on targeted domains. Strengths of this study are a unique web-based health game intervention, the large sample size, a control group without intervention and innovations designed to increase compliance.

   Abstract = {Alopecia areata is an unpredictable hair-loss condition. As there is no cure for alopecia areata and no effective conventional therapy, a substantial number of alopecia areata patients resort to complementary and alternative medical remedies and therapies (CAM). This review on the application of CAM in alopecia areata addresses two pertinent aspects. First, it provides a current overview of the published medical literature on CAM used in alopecia areata, and alopecia areata-related studies. Second, it presents a thorough assessment of the considerations and limitations of the use of CAM for the treatment of alopecia areata. A systematic MEDLINE search yielded 13 studies of the clinical use of CAM in the management of alopecia areata, all belonging to one of the five main categories of CAM. Methodological quality was analyzed using objective assessment scores (Wilson and Lawrence scores). Unfortunately, no study was of sufficient internal validity to provide robust evidence of the benefit of CAM. This might be attributable to several specific disease characteristics of alopecia areata, which require an especially solid trial design to properly assess the therapeutic effects of CAM. The review concludes with some recommendations for improving the quality of trials incorporating CAM in the treatment of alopecia areata.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dissociation is a mental process with psychological and somatoform manifestations, which is closely related to hypnotic suggestibility and essentially shows the ability to obtain distance from reality. An increased tendency to dissociate is a frequently reported characteristic of patients with functional neurological symptoms and syndromes (FNSS), which account for a substantial part of all neurological admissions. This review aims to investigate what heart rate variability (HRV), EEG and neuroimaging data (MRI) reveal about the nature of dissociation and related conditions. METHODS: Studies reporting HRV, EEG and neuroimaging data related to hypnosis, dissociation and FNSS were identified by searching the electronic databases Pubmed and ScienceDirect. RESULTS: The majority of the identified studies concerned the physiological characteristics of hypnosis; relatively few investigations on dissociation related FNSS were identified. General findings were increased parasympathetic functioning during hypnosis (as measured by HRV), and lower HRV in patients with FNSS. The large variety of EEG and functional MRI investigations with diverse results challenges definite conclusions, but evidence suggests that subcortical as well as (pre)frontal regions serve emotion regulation in dissociative conditions. Functional connectivity analyses suggest the presence of altered brain networks in patients with FNSS, in which limbic areas have an increased influence on motor preparatory regions. CONCLUSIONS: HRV, EEG and (functional) MRI are sensitive methods to detect physiological changes related to dissociation and dissociative disorders such as FNSS, and can possibly provide more information about their aetiology. The use of such measures could eventually provide biomarkers for earlier identification of patients at risk and appropriate treatment of dissociative conditions.},

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) resemble epileptic seizures, but lack epileptiform brain activity. Instead, the cause is assumed to be psychogenic. An abnormal coping strategy may be exhibited by PNES patients, as indicated by their increased tendency to dissociate. Investigation of resting-state networks may reveal altered routes of information and emotion processing in PNES patients. The authors therefore investigated whether PNES patients differ from healthy controls in their resting-state functional connectivity characteristics and whether these connections are associated with the tendency to dissociate. METHODS: 11 PNES patients without psychiatric comorbidity and 12 healthy controls underwent task-related paradigms (picture-encoding and Stroop paradigms) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Global cognitive performance was tested using the Raven's Matrices test and participants completed questionnaires for evaluating dissociation. Functional connectivity analysis on rsfMRI was based on seed regions extracted from task-related fMRI activation maps. RESULTS: The patients displayed a significantly lower cognitive performance and significantly higher dissociation scores. No significant differences were found between the picture-encoding and Stroop colour-naming activation maps between controls and patients with PNES. However, functional connectivity maps from the rsfMRI were statistically different. For PNES patients, stronger connectivity values between areas involved in emotion (insula), executive control (inferior frontal gyrus and parietal cortex) and movement (precentral sulcus) were observed, which were significantly associated with dissociation scores. CONCLUSION: The abnormal, strong functional connectivity in PNES patients provides a neurophysiological correlate for the underlying psychoform and somatoform dissociation mechanism where emotion can influence executive control, resulting in altered motor function (eg, seizure-like episodes).},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are epilepsy-like episodes which have an emotional rather than organic origin. Although PNES have often been related to the process of dissociation, the psychopathology is still poorly understood. To elucidate underlying mechanisms, the current study applied independent component analysis (ICA) on resting-state fMRI to investigate alterations within four relevant networks, associated with executive, fronto-parietal, sensorimotor, and default mode activation, and within a visual network to examine specificity of between-group differences. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with PNES without psychiatric or neurologic comorbidities and twenty-seven healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MR imaging at 3.0T (Philips Achieva). Additional neuropsychological testing included Raven's Matrices test and dissociation questionnaires. ICA with dual regression was used to identify resting-state networks in all participants, and spatial maps of the networks of interest were compared between patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients displayed higher dissociation scores, lower cognitive performance and increased contribution of the orbitofrontal, insular and subcallosal cortex in the fronto-parietal network; the cingulate and insular cortex in the executive control network; the cingulate gyrus, superior parietal lobe, pre- and postcentral gyri and supplemental motor cortex in the sensorimotor network; and the precuneus and (para-) cingulate gyri in the default-mode network. The connectivity strengths within these regions of interest significantly correlated with dissociation scores. No between-group differences were found within the visual network, which was examined to determine specificity of between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: PNES patients displayed abnormalities in several resting-state networks that provide neuronal correlates for an underlying dissociation mechanism.},

   Abstract = {Objective: Little is known about the (peri-) ictal changes in autonomic nervous system activity of epileptic
seizures. Such information may be useful for seizure prediction paradigms and differential diagnosis between
epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). The current study investigated the peri-ictal time course of
heart rate variability (HRV) measures, which reflect autonomic nervous system functioning.
Methods: HRV measures were extracted from electrocardiography data collected during 1-7 days of videoelectroencephalography
monitoring of 17 patients with epilepsy and 20 patients with PNES. Heart rate (HR) and
HRV measures (standard deviation of average beat-to-beat intervals (SDANN), root mean square of successive
differences (RMSSD), high frequency (HF) power, low frequency (LF) power and very low frequency (VLF) power)
were averaged over consecutive five-minute intervals. Quantitative analyses of Poincaré plot parameters (SD1, SD2
and SD1/SD2 ratio) were also performed. In addition, differences with HRV parameters of patients with PNES were
explored.
Results: In epilepsy, no significant pre-ictal changes in HR and HRV parameters were observed. During
seizures, HR, SDANN, SD1 and SD1/SD2 ratio significantly increased while VLF power significantly decreased. In
the five-minute interval immediately following seizures, HR, SDANN and SD1 were back to pre-seizure levels, while
VLF power remained significantly decreased and SD1/SD2 ratio remained significantly increased. Significant
between-group differences were identified for several pre-ictal and ictal HRV parameters, but not for post-ictal
measurements.
Conclusion: The ictal HR and HRV changes reflect increased sympathetic system activation during epileptic
seizures. The HRV parameters of patients with epilepsy differed significantly from the peri-ictal HRV pattern of
patients with PNES, which suggested increased sympathetic system activation and decreased vagal tone shortly
before PNES and return to normal levels shortly after the episode. Implications for differential diagnosis and
treatment are discussed.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) resemble epileptic seizures but originate from psychogenic rather than organic causes. Patients with PNESs are often unable or unwilling to reflect on underlying emotions. To gain more insight into the internal states of patients during PNES episodes, this study explored the time course of heart rate variability (HRV) measures, which provide information about autonomic nervous system functioning and arousal. METHODS: Heart rate variability measures were extracted from double-lead electrocardiography data collected during 1-7days of video-electroencephalography monitoring of 20 patients with PNESs, in whom a total number of 118 PNESs was recorded. Heart rate (HR) and HRV measures in time and frequency domains (standard deviation of average beat-to-beat intervals (SDANN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high-frequency (HF) power, low-frequency (LF) power, and very low-frequency (VLF) power) were averaged over consecutive five-minute intervals. Additionally, quantitative analyses of Poincare plot parameters (SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2 ratio) were performed. RESULTS: In the five-minute interval before PNES, HR significantly (p<0.05) increased (d=2.5), whereas SDANN (d=-0.03) and VLF power (d=-0.05) significantly decreased. During PNES, significant increases in HF power (d=0.0006), SD1 (d=0.031), and SD2 (d=0.016) were observed. In the five-minute interval immediately following PNES, SDANN (d=0.046) and VLF power (d=0.073) significantly increased, and HR (d=-5.1) and SD1/SD2 ratio (d=-0.14) decreased, compared to the interval preceding PNES. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that PNES episodes are preceded by increased sympathetic functioning, which is followed by an increase in parasympathetic functioning during and after PNES. Future research needs to identify the exact nature of the increased arousal that precedes PNES.},

   Abstract = {Sin3 forms the scaffold for a multiprotein corepressor complex that silences transcription via the action of histone deacetylases. Sin3 is recruited to the DNA by several DNA binding repressors, such as the helix-loop-helix proteins of the Mad family. Here, we elaborate on the Mad-Sin3 interaction based on a binding study, solution structure, and dynamics of the PAH2 domain of mSin3 in complex to an extended Sin3 interacting domain (SID) of 24 residues of Mad1. We show that SID residues Met7 and Glu23, outside the previously defined minimal binding motif, mediate additional hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with PAH2. On the basis of these results we propose an extended consensus sequence describing the PAH2-SID interaction specifically for the Mad family, showing that residues outside the hydrophobic core of the SID interact with PAH2 and modulate binding affinity to appropriate levels.},

   Abstract = {The brain can be considered a network, existing of multiple interconnected areas with various functions. MRI provides opportunities to map the large-scale network organization of the brain. We tap into the neurobiochemical dimension of these networks, as neuronal functioning and signal trafficking across distributed brain regions relies on the release and presence of neurotransmitters. Using high-field MR spectroscopic imaging at 7.0T, we obtained a non-invasive snapshot of the spatial distribution of the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate, and investigated interregional associations of these neurotransmitters. We demonstrate that interregional correlations of glutamate and GABA concentrations can be conceptualized as networks. Furthermore, patients with epilepsy display an increased number of glutamate and GABA connections and increased average strength of the GABA network. The increased glutamate and GABA connectivity in epilepsy might indicate a disrupted neurotransmitter balance. In addition to epilepsy, the 'neurotransmitter networks' concept might also provide new insights for other neurological diseases.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: While PRESS is often employed to measure glutamate concentrations, MEGA-PRESS enables simultaneous Glx (glutamate and glutamine) and GABA measurements. This study aimed to compare validation, repeatability, and concordance of different approaches for glutamate quantification at 3T to aid future studies in their selection of the appropriate sequence and quantification method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine phantoms with different glutamate and glutamine concentrations and five healthy participants were scanned twice to assess respectively the validation and repeatability of measurements with PRESS and MEGA-PRESS. To assess concordance between the different methods, results from 95 human participants were compared. PRESS, MEGA-PRESS (i.e. difference), and the MEGA-PRESS OFF spectra were analyzed with both LCModel and Gannet. RESULTS: In vitro, excellent agreement was shown between actual and measured glutamate concentrations for all measurements (r>0.98). In vivo CVs were better for PRESS (2.9%) than MEGA-PRESS (4.9%) and MEGA-PRESS OFF (4.2%). However, the concordance between the sequences was low (PRESS and MEGA-PRESS OFF, r=0.3) to modest (MEGA-PRESS versus MEGA-PRESS OFF, r=0.8). CONCLUSION: Both PRESS and MEGA-PRESS can be employed to measure in vivo glutamate concentrations, although PRESS shows a better repeatability. Comparisons between in vivo glutamate measures of different sequences however need to be interpreted cautiously.},

   Abstract = {As a large number of patients with epilepsy do not respond favorably to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), a better understanding of treatment failure and the cause of adverse side effects is required. The working mechanisms of AEDs also alter neurotransmitter concentrations and brain activity, which can be measured using MR spectroscopy and functional MR imaging, respectively. This review presents an overview of clinical research of MR spectroscopy and functional MR imaging studies to the effects of AEDs on the brain. Despite the scarcity of studies associating MR findings to the effectiveness of AEDs, the current research shows clear potential regarding this matter. Several GABAergic AEDs have been shown to increase the GABA concentration, which was related to seizure reductions, while language problems due to topiramate have been associated with altered activation patterns measured with functional MR imaging. MR spectroscopy and functional MR imaging provide biomarkers that may predict individual treatment outcomes, and enable the assessment of mechanisms of treatment failure and cognitive side effects.},

   Abstract = {AIM: To increase our insight in the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive side-effects of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. METHODS: The relation between functional magnetic resonance-acquired brain network measures, AED use, and cognitive function was investigated. Three groups of patients with epilepsy with a different risk profile for developing cognitive side effects were included: A "low risk" category (lamotrigine or levetiracetam, n = 16), an "intermediate risk" category (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, or valproate, n = 34) and a "high risk" category (topiramate, n = 5). Brain connectivity was assessed using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theoretical network analysis. The Computerized Visual Searching Task was used to measure central information processing speed, a common cognitive side effect of AED treatment. RESULTS: Central information processing speed was lower in patients taking AEDs from the intermediate and high risk categories, compared with patients from the low risk category. The effect of risk category on global efficiency was significant (P < 0.05, ANCOVA), with a significantly higher global efficiency for patient from the low category compared with the high risk category (P < 0.05, post-hoc test). Risk category had no significant effect on the clustering coefficient (ANCOVA, P > 0.2). Also no significant associations between information processing speed and global efficiency or the clustering coefficient (linear regression analysis, P > 0.15) were observed. CONCLUSION: Only the four patients taking topiramate show aberrant network measures, suggesting that alterations in functional brain network organization may be only subtle and measureable in patients with more severe cognitive side effects.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are effective in suppressing epileptic seizures, they also induce (cognitive) side effects, with mental slowing as a general effect. This study aimed to assess whether concentrations of MR detectable neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, are associated with mental slowing in patients with epilepsy taking AEDs. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from patients with localization-related epilepsy using a variety of AEDs from three risk categories, i.e., AEDs with low, intermediate, and high risks of developing cognitive problems. Patients underwent 3T MR spectroscopy, including a PRESS (n=55) and MEGA-PRESS (n=43) sequence, to estimate occipital glutamate and GABA concentrations, respectively. The association was calculated between neurotransmitter concentrations and central information processing speed, which was measured using the Computerized Visual Searching Task (CVST) and compared between the different risk categories. RESULTS: Combining all groups, patients with lower processing speeds had lower glutamate concentrations. Patients in the high-risk category had a lower glutamate concentration and lower processing speed compared with patients taking low-risk AEDs. Patients taking intermediate-risk AEDs also had a lower glutamate concentration compared with patients taking low-risk AEDs, but processing speed did not differ significantly between those groups. No associations were found between the GABA concentration and risk category or processing speed. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a relation is shown between glutamate concentration and both mental slowing and AED use. It is suggested that the reduced excitatory action, reflected by lowered glutamate concentrations, may have contributed to the slowing of information processing in patients using AEDs with higher risks of cognitive side effects.},

   Abstract = {Neurovascular pathology concurs with protein accumulation, as the brain vasculature is important for waste clearance. Interstitial solutes, such as amyloid-beta, were previously thought to be primarily cleared from the brain by blood-brain barrier transport. Recently, the glymphatic system was discovered, in which cerebrospinal fluid is exchanged with interstitial fluid, facilitated by the aquaporin-4 water channels on the astroglial endfeet. Glymphatic flow can clear solutes from the interstitial space. Blood-brain barrier transport and glymphatic clearance likely serve complementary roles with partially overlapping mechanisms providing a well-conditioned neuronal environment. Disruption of these mechanisms can lead to protein accumulation and may initiate neurodegenerative disorders, for instance amyloid-beta accumulation and Alzheimer's disease. Although both mechanisms seem to have a similar purpose, their interaction has not been clearly discussed previously. This review focusses on this interaction in healthy and pathological conditions. Future health initiatives improving waste clearance might delay or even prevent onset of neurodegenerative disorders. Defining glymphatic flow kinetics using imaging may become an alternative way to identify those at risk of Alzheimer's disease.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) and cardiac troponin T (cTNT) are associated with cognitive performance. Whether this extends to individuals <60 years of age is unclear. We investigated whether age modified the associations between NT-proBNP and cTNT and cognitive performance and structural brain changes. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In 3011 individuals (60+/-8 years; 49% women), NT-proBNP and cTNT, memory, information processing speed and executive functioning, grey matter (GM) and white matter, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were determined. We used regression, adjusted for educational level, cardiovascular factors, and lifestyle factors, to test whether cross-sectional associations between biomarkers and cognitive performance and structural brain changes were modified by age (<60 versus >/=60 years). >/=60 years, higher NT-proBNP was associated with lower memory (beta [SD] per 10-fold higher level [95% confidence interval (CI)], -0.11 [-0.22 to -0.00]), information processing speed (-0.12 [95% CI, -0.21 to -0.03]), executive functioning (-0.12 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.03]), and smaller GM (beta [mL] per 10-fold higher level, -6.89 [95% CI, -11.58 to -2.20]). Additionally, higher cTNT was associated with lower memory (-0.33 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.12]) and information processing speed (-0.17 [95% CI, -0.3 to -0.01]); with smaller GM (-16.07 [95% CI, -24.90 to -7.24]) and greater WMH (10(beta) WMH per 10-fold higher level, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.10-0.52]). <60 years, NT-proBNP and cTNT were not associated with cognitive performance (Pinteraction, <0.10). In contrast, higher NT-proBNP was associated with smaller GM (-7.43 [95% CI, -11.70 to -3.16]) and greater WMH (0.13 [95% CI, 0.01-0.25]; Pinteraction,>0.10). Higher cTNT was associated with greater WMH (0.18 [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.37]; Pinteraction,>0.10) but not with GM (0.07 [95% CI, -6.87 to 7.02]; Pinteraction,<0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of cardiac injury are continuously associated with structural brain changes in both older and younger individuals but with poorer cognitive performance only in older individuals. These findings stress the continuous nature of the heart-brain axis in the development of cognitive impairment.},

   Abstract = {Chronic epilepsy is frequently accompanied by serious cognitive side-effects. Clinical factors are important, but cannot account entirely for this cognitive comorbidity. Therefore, research is focusing on the underlying cerebral mechanisms to understand the development of cognitive dysfunction. In the past two decades, functional MRI techniques have been applied extensively to the study of cognitive impairment in chronic epilepsy. However, because of wide variation in study designs, analysis methods, and data presentation, interpretation of these studies has become increasingly difficult for clinicians. In patients with localisation-related epilepsy, whether findings of functional MRI represent the underlying neuronal substrate for cognitive decline remains a subject of debate.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: Impaired memory performance is the most frequently reported cognitive problem in patients with chronic epilepsy. To examine memory deficits many studies have focused on the role of the mesiotemporal lobe, mostly with hippocampal abnormalities. However, the role of the prefrontal brain remains unresolved. To investigate the neuronal correlates of working memory dysfunction in patients without structural lesions, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment, hippocampal and cerebral volumetry, and functional magnetic resonance imaging of temporal and frontal memory networks was performed. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy and 21 healthy controls underwent neuropsychological assessment of intelligence (IQ) and memory. On T(1) -weighted images obtained by 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), volumetry of the hippocampi and the cerebrum was performed. Functional MRI (fMRI) was performed with a novel picture encoding and Sternberg paradigm that activated different memory-mediating brain regions. Functional connectivity analysis comprised cross-correlation of signal time-series of the most strongly activated regions involved in working memory function. KEY FINDINGS: Patients with epilepsy displayed lower IQ values; impaired transient aspects of information processing, as indicated by lower scores on the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST); and decreased short-term memory performance relative to healthy controls, as measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale subtests for working memory, and word and figure recognition. This could not be related to any hippocampal volume changes. No group differences were found regarding volumetry or fMRI-derived functional activation. In the Sternberg paradigm, a network involving the anterior cingulate and the middle and inferior frontal gyrus was activated. A reduced strength of four connections in this prefrontal network was associated with the DSST and word recognition performance in the patient group. SIGNIFICANCE: Deficits in the processes involved in transient working memory, and to a lesser extent in short-term memory, in patients with localization-related epilepsy of both temporal and extratemporal origin cannot be attributed to hippocampal atrophy or function only, but are also related to reduced functional connectivity in the prefrontal brain. Because patients with symptomatic lesions or mesiotemporal sclerosis were excluded from this study, the results cannot be explained by structural lesions. Therefore, the current findings highlight the influence of epilepsy on the prefrontal network integrity as a possible underlying problem of memory impairment.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND: An often underestimated cognitive morbidity in patients with epilepsy is language dysfunction. To investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying neuropsychological language impairment, activation maps and functional connectivity networks were studied by fMRI of language. METHOD: Fifty-two patients with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy and 27 healthy controls underwent neuropsychological assessment of IQ, word fluency, and text reading. fMRI was performed with a standard covert word-generation and text-reading paradigm. Functional connectivity analysis comprised cross-correlation of signal time series of the characteristic and most strongly activated regions involved in the language tasks. RESULTS: After careful selection, 34 patients and 20 healthy controls were found eligible for analysis. Patients displayed lower IQ, lower fluency word count, and lower number of words correctly read compared to controls. fMRI activation maps did not differ significantly between patients and controls. For the word-generation paradigm, patients with epilepsy had significantly lower functional connectivity than controls in the prefrontal network. Patients performing worse on the word-fluency test demonstrated a significantly lower mean functional connectivity than controls. Text reading demonstrated lower functional connectivity in patients with epilepsy in the frontotemporal network. Similarly, lower mean functional connectivity was observed in patients with lowest reading performance compared to controls. A relation between reduced functional connectivity and performance on word-fluency and text-reading tests was demonstrated in epilepsy patients. CONCLUSION: Impaired performance on language assessment in epilepsy patients is associated with loss of functional connectivity in the cognitive language networks.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent comorbid disorder in epilepsy which has been associated with high seizure frequency. We examined the effect of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCS) on cognitive dysfunction using neuropsychological assessment and fMRI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with localization-related epilepsy of varying etiologies and SGTCS underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment. Functional MRI was performed probing the frontal and temporal lobes with two paradigms aimed at investigating speed of mental processing and working memory. RESULTS: A high number of total lifetime SGTCS was associated with lower intelligence scores. Moreover, a trend towards cognitive decline related to the number of SGTCS was observed. A relatively increased prefrontal activation related to the number of SGTCS was demonstrated, plus a trend towards a decreased activation in the frontotemporal areas. CONCLUSION: High numbers of SGTCS are associated with a drop in intelligence scores and altered prefrontal brain activation. A shift from frontotemporal to prefrontal activation seems to have occurred, suggesting that a functional reorganization of working memory is induced by a high number of SGTCS. It remains uncertain if this reorganization reflects a compensation mechanism, or the underlying pathological processes of cognitive dysfunction.},

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between possibly altered whole brain topology and intellectual decline in chronic epilepsy, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment and graph theoretical network analysis of fMRI was performed. METHODS: Forty-one adult patients with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy and 23 healthy controls underwent an intelligence test and fMRI with a silent-word generation paradigm. A set of undirected graphs was constructed by cross-correlating the signal time series of 893 cortical and subcortical regions. Possible changes in cerebral network efficiency were assessed by performing graph theoretical network analysis. RESULTS: Healthy subjects displayed efficient small world properties, characterized by high clustering and short path lengths. On the contrary, in patients with epilepsy a disruption of both local segregation and global integration was found. An association of more pronounced intellectual decline with more disturbed local segregation was observed in the patient group. The effect of antiepileptic drug use on cognitive decline was mediated by decreased clustering. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that chronic localization-related epilepsy causes cognitive deficits by inducing global cerebral network changes instead of a localized disruption only. Whether this is the result of epilepsy per se or the use of antiepileptic drugs remains to be elucidated. For application in clinical practice, future studies should address the relevance of altered cerebral network topology in prediction of cognitive deficits and monitoring of therapeutic interventions.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravoxel incoherent motion imaging can measure both microvascular and parenchymal abnormalities simultaneously. The contamination of CSF signal can be suppressed using inversion recovery preparation. The clinical feasibility of inversion recovery-intravoxel incoherent motion imaging was investigated in patients with cerebrovascular disease by studying its reproducibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with cerebrovascular disease (66 +/- 8 years of age) underwent inversion recovery-intravoxel incoherent motion imaging twice. The reproducibility of the perfusion volume fraction and parenchymal diffusivity was calculated with the coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and the repeatability coefficient. ROIs included the normal-appearing white matter, cortex, deep gray matter, white matter hyperintensities, and vascular lesions. RESULTS: Values for the perfusion volume fraction ranged from 2.42 to 3.97 x10(-2) and for parenchymal diffusivity from 7.20 to 9.11 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s, with higher values found in the white matter hyperintensities and vascular lesions. Coefficients of variation were <3.70% in normal-appearing tissue and <9.15% for lesions. Intraclass correlation coefficients were good to excellent, showing values ranging from 0.82 to 0.99 in all ROIs, except the deep gray matter and cortex, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.66 and 0.54, respectively. The repeatability coefficients ranged from 0.15 to 0.96 x 10(-2) and 0.10 to 0.37 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s for perfusion volume fraction and parenchymal diffusivity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Good reproducibility of inversion recovery-intravoxel incoherent motion imaging was observed with low coefficients of variation and high intraclass correlation coefficients in normal-appearing tissue and lesion areas in cerebrovascular disease. Good reproducibility of inversion recovery-intravoxel incoherent motion imaging in cerebrovascular disease is feasible in monitoring disease progression or treatment responses in the clinic.},

   Abstract = {PURPOSE: Increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability has been shown to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease and it may provide an early functional marker of progression or treatment effects. The aim of the study was to investigate the test-retest reproducibility and influencing factors of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in measuring subtle leakage in patients with cerebrovascular disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DCE-MRI (3T) was performed on two separate days in 16 patients (age 66 +/- 9 years) with cerebrovascular disease, prospectively. The leakage rate was quantified for white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) using the Patlak graphical approach with individual vascular input functions (VIFs). Furthermore, the influence of session-averaged VIFs, the average of the VIFs obtained on two days, and shorter scan times (range 5-25 minutes) on the reproducibility were evaluated in WM and GM. RESULTS: Coefficients of variation (CV) </=14.4% (WM and GM), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.77 (WM) and 0.49 (GM), were observed for the leakage rate. Session-averaged VIFs hardly affected these results (CV </=13.4%). The repeatability coefficients (RCs) of the leakage rate decreased from 2.7.10(-3) to 0.4.10(-3) min(-1) in WM (P < 0.01) and 4.4.10(-3) to 0.9.10(-3) min(-1) in GM (P < 0.01) with increasing scan time (range 5-25 minutes). CONCLUSION: Based on the moderate CVs and moderate-to-excellent ICCs, we demonstrate that measuring subtle BBB leakage using DCE-MRI is moderate-to-excellent reproducible. Longer scan times improve the reproducibility. The provided RCs at various scan times may assist future clinical studies investigating BBB leakage using DCE-MRI.

   Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is associated with microvascular and parenchymal alterations. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI has been proposed to simultaneously measure both the microvascular perfusion and parenchymal diffusivity. This study aimed to evaluate the application of IVIM in cSVD to assess the microvasculature and parenchymal microstructure. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with cSVD (age 70 +/- 11 y) and thirty-nine controls (age 69 +/- 12 y) underwent IVIM imaging (3T). Group differences of the perfusion volume fraction f and the parenchymal diffusivity D were investigated using multivariable linear regression accounted for age, sex and cardiovascular factors. To examine the relation between the IVIM measures and the disease severity on structural MRI, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load served as surrogate measure of the disease severity. RESULTS: Patients had a larger f (p < 0.024) in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) than controls. Higher D (p < 0.031) was also observed for patients compared with controls in the NAWM and grey matter. Both f (p < 0.024) and D (p < 0.001) in the NAWM and grey matter increased with WMH load. CONCLUSIONS: The increased diffusivity reflects the predicted microstructural tissue impairment in cSVD. Unexpectedly, an increased perfusion volume fraction was observed in patients. Future studies are needed to reveal the precise nature of the increased perfusion volume fraction. IVIM imaging showed that the increases of f and D in cSVD were both related to disease severity, which suggests the potential of IVIM imaging to provide a surrogate marker for the progression of cSVD.},

   Abstract = {Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage increases with age and is involved in the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). We examined the relationship between BBB leakage and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and cognition, in cSVD patients and healthy controls. Seventy-seven patients with clinically overt cSVD and thirty-nine age matched healthy controls underwent dynamic contract-enhanced and structural brain MRI and neuropsychological assessment. We quantified BBB leakage volume and rate in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), WMH and cortical grey matter (CGM). Larger leakage volume and lower leakage rate in WMH were associated with larger WMH volume in cSVD but not in controls. Higher leakage rate in NAWM was associated with lower scores on executive function and information processing speed in healthy controls, whereas no relation with cognition was found in cSVD patients. Our findings support the involvement of BBB leakage in cSVD and aging. They also suggest that the mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in cSVD is more complex and multifactorial in cSVD compared with normal aging.},

   Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with cognitive impairment. This may be because of decreased microstructural integrity and microvascular perfusion, but data on these relationships are scarce. We determined the relationship between cognition and microvascular perfusion and microstructural integrity in SVD patients, using intravoxel incoherent motion imaging-a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging technique designed to determine microvascular perfusion and microstructural integrity simultaneously. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with SVD and 39 controls underwent intravoxel incoherent motion imaging and neuropsychological assessment. Parenchymal diffusivity D (a surrogate measure of microstructural integrity) and perfusion-related measure fD* were calculated for the normal appearing white matter, white matter hyperintensities, and cortical gray matter. The associations between cognitive performance and D and fD* were determined. RESULTS: In SVD patients, multivariable analysis showed that lower fD* in the normal appearing white matter and cortical gray matter was associated with lower overall cognition (P=0.03 and P=0.002, respectively), lower executive function (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively), and lower information-processing speed (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively). D was not associated with cognitive function. In controls, no association was found between D, fD*, and cognition. CONCLUSIONS: In SVD patients, lower cognitive performance is associated with lower microvascular perfusion in the normal appearing white matter and cortical gray matter. Our results support recent findings that both cortical gray matter and normal appearing white matter perfusion may play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in SVD.

   Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may occur in normal aging but may also play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), we used dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI to quantify the rate and the spatial extent of BBB leakage in patients with cSVD and age- and sex-matched controls to discern cSVD-related BBB leakage from aging-related leakage. METHODS: We performed structural brain MRI and DCE-MRI in 80 patients with clinically overt cSVD and 40 age- and sex-matched controls. Using the Patlak pharmacokinetic model, we calculated the leakage rate. The mean leakage rate and relative leakage volume were calculated using noise-corrected histogram analysis. Leakage rate and leakage volume were compared between patients with cSVD and controls for the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cortical gray matter (CGM), and deep gray matter. RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors showed that the leakage volume of the NAWM, WMH, and CGM was significantly larger in patients with cSVD compared with controls. No significant difference was found for leakage rate in any of the tissue regions. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a larger tissue volume with subtle BBB leakage in patients with cSVD than in controls. This was shown in the NAWM, WMH, and CGM, supporting the generalized nature of cSVD.},
