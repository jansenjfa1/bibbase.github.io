   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia, a hypertensive pregnancy disorder, is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality with remote cardio- and cerebrovascular implications. After preeclampsia, women may report serious disabling cognitive complaints, especially involving executive function, but the extent and time course of these complaints are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact of preeclampsia on perceived maternal cognitive functioning decades after pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This study is part of a cross-sectional case control study named Queen of Hearts (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02347540), a collaboration study of five tertiary referral centers within the Netherlands investigating long-term effects of preeclampsia. Eligible participants were females aged >/=18 years after preeclampsia and after normotensive pregnancy between six months and 30 years after their first (complicated) pregnancy. Preeclampsia was defined as new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation along with proteinuria, fetal growth restriction, or other maternal organ dysfunction. Women with a history of hypertension, autoimmune disease, or kidney disease prior to their first pregnancy were excluded. Attenuation of higher-order cognitive functions, i.e., executive function, was measured with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults. Crude and covariate-adjusted absolute and relative risks of clinical attenuation over time after (complicated) pregnancy were determined with moderated logistic and log-binomial regression. RESULTS: This study included 1036 women with a history of preeclampsia and 527 women with normotensive pregnancies. Regarding overall executive function, 23.2% (95%-confidence interval 19.0 to 28.1%) of women experienced clinically significant attenuation after preeclampsia compared to 2.2% (95%-confidence interval 0.8 to 6.0%) of controls just after childbirth; adjusted relative risk of 9.20 (95%-confidence interval 3.33 to 25.38). Group differences diminished yet remained statistically significant at least 19 years postpartum. Regardless of a history of preeclampsia, women with lower educational attainment, mood or anxiety disorders, or obesity were especially at risk. Neither severity of preeclampsia, multiple gestation, method of delivery, preterm birth, nor perinatal death related to overall executive function. CONCLUSION: After preeclampsia, women were nine times more likely to experience clinical attenuation of higher-order cognitive functions as compared to after normotensive pregnancy. Despite overall steady improvement, elevated risks persisted over decades after childbirth.},

   abstract = {Working memory is a temporary storage system under attentional control. It is believed to play a central role in online processing of complex cognitive information and may also play a role in social cognition and interpersonal interactions. Adolescents with a disorder on the autism spectrum display problems in precisely these domains. Social impairments, communication difficulties, and repetitive interests and activities are core domains of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and executive function problems are often seen throughout the spectrum. As the main cognitive theories of ASD, including the theory of mind deficit hypotheses, weak central coherence account, and the executive dysfunction theory, still fail to explain the broad spectrum of symptoms, a new perspective on the etiology of ASD is needed. Deficits in working memory are central to many theories of psychopathology, and are generally linked to frontal-lobe dysfunction. This article will review neuropsychological and (functional) brain imaging studies on working memory in adolescents with ASD. Although still disputed, it is concluded that within the working memory system specific problems of spatial working memory are often seen in adolescents with ASD. These problems increase when information is more complex and greater demands on working memory are made. Neuroimaging studies indicate a more global working memory processing or connectivity deficiency, rather than a focused deficit in the prefrontal cortex. More research is needed to relate these working memory difficulties and neuroimaging results in ASD to the behavioral difficulties as seen in individuals with a disorder on the autism spectrum.},

   abstract = {AIM: People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically have deficits in the working memory (WM) system. WM is found to be an essential chain in successfully navigating in the social world. We hypothesize that brain networks for WM have an altered network integrity in ASD compared to controls. METHODS: Thirteen adolescents (one female) with autistic disorder (n = 1), Asperger's disorder (n = 7), or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (n = 5), and 13 typically developing healthy control adolescents (one female) participated in this study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using an n-back task and in resting state. RESULTS: The analysis of the behavioral data revealed deficits in WM performance in ASD, but only when tested to the limit. Adolescents with ASD showed lower binary global efficiency in the WM network than the healthy control group with n-back and resting-state data. This correlated with diagnostic scores for total problems, reciprocity, and language. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with higher-functioning autism have difficulty with the WM system, which is typically compensated. Functional MRI markers of brain network organization in ASD are related to characteristics of autism as represented in diagnostic scores. Therefore, functional MRI provides neuronal correlates for memory difficulties in adolescents with ASD.},

   abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain the measured signal is corrupted by several (e.g. physiological, motion, and thermal) noise sources and depends on the image acquisition. Imaging at ultrahigh field strength is becoming increasingly popular as it offers increased spatial accuracy. The latter is of particular benefit in brainstem neuroimaging given the small cross-sectional area of most nuclei. However, physiological noise scales with field strength in fMRI acquisitions. Although this problem is in part solved by decreasing voxel size, it is clear that adequate physiological denoising is of utmost importance in brainstem-focused fMRI experiments. Multi-echo sequences have been reported to facilitate highly effective denoising through TE-dependence of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals, in a denoising method referred to as multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA). It has not been explored previously how ME-ICA compares to other data-driven denoising approaches at ultrahigh field strength. In the current study, we compared the efficacy of several denoising methods, including anatomical component based correction (aCompCor), Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts (ICA-AROMA) aggressive and non-aggressive options, ME-ICA, and a combination of ME-ICA and aCompCor. We assessed several data quality metrics, including temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), delta variation signal (DVARS), spectral density of the global signal, functional connectivity and Shannon spectral entropy. Moreover, we looked at the ability of each method to uncouple the global signal and respiration. In line with previous reports at lower field strengths, we demonstrate that after applying ME-ICA, the data is best post-processed in order to remove spatially diffuse noise with a method such as aCompCor. Our findings indicate that ME-ICA combined with aCompCor and the aggressive option of ICA-AROMA are highly effective denoising approaches for multi-echo data acquired at 7T. ME-ICA combined with aCompCor potentially preserves more signal-of-interest as compared to the aggressive option of ICA-AROMA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microvascular dysfunction is involved in the development of various cerebral disorders. It may contribute to these disorders by disrupting white matter tracts and altering brain connectivity, but evidence is scarce. We investigated the association between multiple biomarkers of microvascular function and whole-brain white matter connectivity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional data from The Maastricht Study, a Dutch population-based cohort (n=4326; age, 59.4+/-8.6 years; 49.7% women). Measures of microvascular function included urinary albumin excretion, central retinal arteriolar and venular calibers, composite scores of flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation, and plasma biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and von Willebrand factor). White matter connectivity was calculated from 3T diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the number (average node degree) and organization (characteristic path length, global efficiency, clustering coefficient, and local efficiency) of white matter connections. A higher plasma biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction composite score was associated with a longer characteristic path length (beta per SD, 0.066 [95% CI, 0.017-0.114]) after adjustment for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and cardiovascular factors but not with any of the other white matter connectivity measures. After multiple comparison correction, this association was nonsignificant. None of the other microvascular function measures were associated with any of the connectivity measures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that microvascular dysfunction as measured by indirect markers is not associated with whole-brain white matter connectivity.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly characterized by functional and communication impairments as well as restrictive and repetitive behavior. The leading hypothesis for the neural basis of autism postulates globally abnormal brain connectivity, which can be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Even in the absence of a task, the brain exhibits a high degree of functional connectivity, known as intrinsic, or resting-state, connectivity. Global default connectivity in individuals with autism versus controls is not well characterized, especially for a high-functioning young population. The aim of this study is to test whether high-functioning adolescents with ASD (HFA) have an abnormal resting-state functional connectivity. Materials and Methods: We performed spatial and temporal analyses on resting-state networks (RSNs) in 13 HFA adolescents and 13 IQ- and age-matched controls. For the spatial analysis, we used probabilistic independent component analysis (ICA) and a permutation statistical method to reveal the RSN differences between the groups. For the temporal analysis, we applied Granger causality to find differences in temporal neurodynamics. Results: Controls and HFA display very similar patterns and strengths of resting-state connectivity. We do not find any significant differences between HFA adolescents and controls in the spatial resting-state connectivity. However, in the temporal dynamics of this connectivity, we did find differences in the causal effect properties of RSNs originating in temporal and prefrontal cortices. Conclusion: The results show a difference between HFA and controls in the temporal neurodynamics from the ventral attention network to the salience-executive network: a pathway involving cognitive, executive, and emotion-related cortices. We hypothesized that this weaker dynamic pathway is due to a subtle trigger challenging the cognitive state prior to the resting state.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Use a conference challenge format to compare machine learning-based gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) reconstruction models using one-quarter of the transients typically acquired during a complete scan. METHODS: There were three tracks: Track 1: simulated data, Track 2: identical acquisition parameters with in vivo data, and Track 3: different acquisition parameters with in vivo data. The mean squared error, signal-to-noise ratio, linewidth, and a proposed shape score metric were used to quantify model performance. Challenge organizers provided open access to a baseline model, simulated noise-free data, guides for adding synthetic noise, and in vivo data. RESULTS: Three submissions were compared. A covariance matrix convolutional neural network model was most successful for Track 1. A vision transformer model operating on a spectrogram data representation was most successful for Tracks 2 and 3. Deep learning (DL) reconstructions with 80 transients achieved equivalent or better SNR, linewidth and fit error compared to conventional 320 transient reconstructions. However, some DL models optimized linewidth and SNR without actually improving overall spectral quality, indicating a need for more robust metrics. CONCLUSION: DL-based reconstruction pipelines have the promise to reduce the number of transients required for GABA-edited MRS.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a congenital malformation of cortical development that often leads to medically refractory epilepsy. Focal resection can be an effective treatment, but is challenging as the surgically relevant abnormality may exceed the MR-visible lesion. The aim of the current study is to develop methodology to characterize the profile of functional connectivity around FCDs using resting-state functional MRI and in the individual patient. The detection of aberrant connectivity may provide a means to more completely delineate the clinically relevant lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen FCD patients (age, mean+/-SD: 31+/-11 years; 11 males) and 16 matched healthy controls (35+/-9 years; 7 males) underwent structural and functional imaging at 3 Tesla. The cortical surface was reconstructed from the T1-weighted scan and the registered functional MRI data was spatially normalized to a common anatomical standard space employing the gyral pattern. Seed-based functional connectivity was determined in all subjects for all dysplasia locations. A single patient was excluded based on an aberrant FCD seed time series. Functional connectivity as a function of geodesic distance (along the cortical surface) was compared between the individual patients and the homotopic normative connectivity profiles derived from the controls. RESULTS: In 12/14 patients, aberrant profiles of functional connectivity were found, which demonstrated both hyper- and hypoconnectivity as well as combinations. Abnormal functional connectivity was typically found (also) beyond the lesion visible on structural MRI, while functional connectivity profiles not related to a lesion appeared normal in patients. CONCLUSION: This novel functional MRI technique has potential for delineating functionally aberrant from normal cortex beyond the structural lesion in FCD, which remains to be confirmed in future research.},

Tractograms are converted to tract segmentations and inter-session reproducibility of tract morphology is assessed using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The coefficient of variation (COV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) are calculated of the following tract metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), volume, and TDI. Analyses are performed both for proximal (deep white matter) and extended (including subcortical white matter) tract segmentations. RESULTS: Proximal DSC values were 0.70-0.92. DSC values were 5-10% lower in extended compared to proximal segmentations. COV/ICC values of FA, ADC, volume and TDI were 1-4%/0.65-0.94, 2-4%/0.62-0.94, 3-22%/0.53-0.96 and 8-31%/0.48-0.70, respectively, with the lower COV and higher ICC values found in the proximal segmentations. CONCLUSION: For all investigated metrics, reproducibility depended on the segmented tract. FA and ADC had relatively low COV and relatively high ICC, indicating clinical potential. Volume had higher COV but its moderate to high ICC values in most tracts still suggest subject-differentiating power. Tract TDI had high COV and relatively low ICC, which reflects unfavorable reproducibility.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is a childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, that is increasingly associated with language impairment. In this study, we tested for a white matter (connectivity) correlate, employing diffusion weighted MRI and language testing. METHODS: Twenty-three children with RE and 23 matched controls (age: 8-14 years) underwent structural (T1-weighted) and diffusion-weighted MRI (b = 1200 s/mm(2), 66 gradient directions) at 3T, as well as neuropsychological language testing. Combining tractography and a cortical segmentation derived from the T1-scan, the rolandic tract were reconstructed (pre- and postcentral gyri), and tract fractional anisotropy (FA) values were compared between patients and controls. Aberrant tracts were tested for correlations with language performance. RESULTS: Several reductions of tract FA were found in patients compared to controls, mostly in the left hemisphere; the most significant effects involved the left inferior frontal (p = 0.005) and supramarginal (p = 0.004) gyrus. In the patient group, lower tract FA values were correlated with lower language performance, among others for the connection between the left postcentral and inferior frontal gyrus (p = 0.043, R = 0.43). CONCLUSION: In RE, structural connectivity is reduced for several connections involving the rolandic regions, from which the epileptiform activity originates. Most of these aberrant tracts involve the left (typically language mediating) hemisphere, notably the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) and the supramarginal gyrus (Wernicke's area). For the former, reduced language performance for lower tract FA was found in the patients. These findings provide a first microstructural white matter correlate for language impairment in RE.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) manifests during a critical phase of brain development, and has been associated with language impairments. Concordant abnormalities in structural and functional connectivity (SC and FC) have been described before. As SC and FC are under mutual influence, the current study investigates abnormalities in the SC-FC synergy in RE. METHODS: Twenty-two children with RE (age, mean +/- SD: 11.3 +/- 2.0 y) and 22 healthy controls (age 10.5 +/- 1.6 y) underwent structural, diffusion weighted, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T. The probabilistic anatomical landmarks atlas was used to parcellate the (sub)cortical gray matter. Constrained spherical deconvolution tractography and correlation of time series were used to assess SC and FC, respectively. The SC-FC correlation was assessed as a function of age for the non-zero structural connections over a range of sparsity values (0.01-0.75). A modularity analysis was performed on the mean SC network of the controls to localize potential global effects to subnetworks. SC and FC were also assessed separately using graph analysis. RESULTS: The SC-FC correlation was significantly reduced in children with RE compared to healthy controls, especially for the youngest participants. This effect was most pronounced in a left and a right centro-temporal network, as well as in a medial parietal network. Graph analysis revealed no prominent abnormalities in SC or FC network organization. CONCLUSION: Since SC and FC converge during normal maturation, our finding of reduced SC-FC correlation illustrates impaired synergy between brain structure and function. More specifically, since this effect was most pronounced in the youngest participants, RE may represent a developmental disorder of delayed brain network maturation. The observed effects seem especially attributable to medial parietal connections, which forms an intermediate between bilateral centro-temporal modules of epileptiform activity, and bear relevance for language function.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Over the last years, evidence has accumulated that rolandic epilepsy (RE) is associated with serious cognitive comorbidities, including language impairment. However, the cerebral mechanism through which epileptiform activity in the rolandic (sensorimotor) areas may affect the language system is unknown. To investigate this, the connectivity between rolandic areas and regions involved in language processing is studied using functional MRI (fMRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: fMRI data was acquired from 22 children with rolandic epilepsy and 22 age-matched controls (age range: 8-14 years), both at rest and using word-generation and reading tasks. Activation map analysis revealed no group differences (FWE-corrected, p < 0.05) and was therefore used to define regions of interest for pooled (patients and controls combined) language activation. Independent component analysis with dual regression was used to identify the sensorimotor resting-state network in all subjects. The associated functional connectivity maps were compared between groups at the regions of interest for language activation identified from the task data. In addition, neuropsychological language testing (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 4th edition) was performed. RESULTS: Functional connectivity with the sensorimotor network was reduced in patients compared to controls (p = 0.011) in the left inferior frontal gyrus, i.e. Broca's area as identified by the word-generation task. No aberrant functional connectivity values were found in the other regions of interest, nor were any associations found between functional connectivity and language performance. Neuropsychological testing confirmed language impairment in patients relative to controls (reductions in core language score, p = 0.03; language content index, p = 0.01; receptive language index, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Reduced functional connectivity was demonstrated between the sensorimotor network and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) in children with RE, which might link epileptiform activity/seizures originating from the sensorimotor cortex to language impairment, and is in line with the identified neuropsychological profile of anterior language dysfunction.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is an idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy with a well-established neuropsychological profile of language impairment. The aim of this study is to provide a functional correlate that links rolandic (sensorimotor) pathology to language problems using functional MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three children with RE (8-14 years old) and 21 matched controls underwent extensive language assessment (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals). fMRI was performed at rest and using word generation, reading, and finger tapping paradigms. Since no activation group differences were found, regions of interest (ROIs) were defined at pooled (patients and controls combined) activation maxima and in contralateral homotopic cortex, and used to assess language lateralization as well as for a resting-state connectivity analysis. Furthermore, the association between connection strength and language performance was investigated. RESULTS: Reduced language performance was found in the children with RE. Bilateral activation was found for both language tasks with some predominance of the left hemisphere in both groups. Compared to controls, patient connectivity was decreased between the left sensorimotor area and right inferior frontal gyrus (p<0.01). For this connection, lower connectivity was associated with lower language scores in the patient group (r=0.49, p=0.02), but not in the controls. CONCLUSION: Language laterality analysis revealed bilateral language representation in the age range under study (8-14 years). As a consequence, the connection of reduced functional connectivity we found represents an impaired interplay between motor and language networks, and aberrant functional connectivity associated with poorer language performance. These findings provide a first neuronal correlate in terms of aberrant resting-state functional connectivity for language impairment in RE.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment is frequent in children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), but its etiology is unknown. With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have explored the relationship between brain activation, functional connectivity, and cognitive functioning in a cohort of pediatric patients with FLE and healthy controls. METHODS: Thirty-two children aged 8-13 years with FLE of unknown cause and 41 healthy age-matched controls underwent neuropsychological assessment and structural and functional brain MRI. We investigated to which extent brain regions activated in response to a working memory task and assessed functional connectivity between distant brain regions. Data of patients were compared to controls, and patients were grouped as cognitively impaired or unimpaired. KEY FINDINGS: Children with FLE showed a global decrease in functional brain connectivity compared to healthy controls, whereas brain activation patterns in children with FLE remained relatively intact. Children with FLE complicated by cognitive impairment typically showed a decrease in frontal lobe connectivity. This decreased frontal lobe connectivity comprised both connections within the frontal lobe as well as connections from the frontal lobe to the parietal lobe, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. SIGNIFICANCE: Decreased functional frontal lobe connectivity is associated with cognitive impairment in pediatric FLE. The importance of impairment of functional integrity within the frontal lobe network, as well as its connections to distant areas, provides new insights in the etiology of the broad-range cognitive impairments in children with FLE.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment is frequent in children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Its etiology remains unknown. With diffusion tensor imaging, we have studied cerebral white matter properties and associations with cognitive functioning in children with FLE and healthy controls. METHODS: Thirty children aged 8-13 years with FLE of unknown cause and 39 healthy age-matched controls underwent neuropsychological assessment, structural and diffusion-weighted brain MRI. Patients were grouped as cognitively impaired or unimpaired, and their white matter diffusion properties were compared with the controls. RESULTS: Children with FLE had reduced apparent diffusion coefficients in various posteriorly located tract bundles, a reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of the white matter tract between the right frontal and right occipital lobe, and smaller volumes of several collections of interlobar bundle tracts, compared with controls. The cognitively impaired patient group demonstrated significant increases in FA of the white matter of both occipital lobes, a reduced FA of white matter tract bundles between the right frontal and both left occipital lobe and subcortical white matter area, and smaller volumes of two collections of tract bundles connecting the frontal lobe with the temporal and parietal lobes, compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Children with FLE had white matter abnormalities mainly in posterior brain regions, not confined to the area of the seizure focus. Cognitively impaired children with FLE showed the most pronounced white matter abnormalities. These possibly reflect disturbed maturation and might be part of the etiology of the cognitive impairment.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognitive impairment is frequent in children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), but its aetiology is unknown. MRI scans often reveal no structural brain abnormalities that could explain the cognitive impairment. This does not exclude more subtle morphological abnormalities that can only be detected by automated morphometric techniques. AIMS: With these techniques, we investigate the relationship between cortical brain morphology and cognitive functioning in a cohort of children with FLE and healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four children aged 8-13 years with FLE of unknown cause and 41 healthy age-matched controls underwent neuropsychological assessment and structural brain MRI. Patients were grouped as cognitively impaired or unimpaired. Intracranial volume, white matter volume, lobular cortical volume, cortical thickness and volumes of cortex structures were compared between patients and controls, and potential correlations with cognitive status were determined. RESULTS: The group of cognitively impaired children with FLE had significantly smaller left temporal cortex volumes, specifically middle temporal grey matter volume and entorhinal cortex thickness. In addition, cognitively impaired children with FLE had smaller volumes of structures in the left and right frontal cortex, right temporal cortex and the left subcortical area. CONCLUSION: Cognitively impaired children with FLE have smaller volumes of various cortex structures within the frontal lobes and in extra-frontal regions, most notably temporal cortex volumes. These findings might well explain the broad scale of cognitive domains affected in children with FLE complicated by cognitive impairment and highlight that FLE impacts on areas beyond the frontal lobe.},

   abstract = {Cognitive impairment is the most common comorbidity in children with epilepsy, but its pathophysiology and predisposing conditions remain unknown. Clinical epilepsy characteristics are not conclusive in determining cognitive outcome. Because many children with epilepsy do not have macrostructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities, the underlying substrate for cognitive impairment may be found at the microstructural or functional level. In the last two decades, new MRI techniques have been developed that have the potential to visualize microstructural or functional abnormalities associated with cognitive impairment. These include volumetric MRI, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and functional MRI (fMRI). All of these techniques have shed new light on various aspects associated with, or underlying, cognitive impairment, although their use in epilepsy has been limited and focused mostly on adults. Therefore, in this review, the use of all these different MRI techniques to unravel cognitive impairment in epilepsy is discussed both in adults and children with epilepsy. Volumetric MRI and VBM have revealed significant volume losses in the area of the seizure focus as well as in distant areas. DTI adds evidence of loss of integrity of connections from the seizure focus to distant areas as well as between distant areas. MRS and fMRI have shown impaired function both in the area of the seizure focus as well as in distant structures. For this review we have compiled and compared findings from the various techniques to conclude that cognitive impairment in epilepsy results from a network disorder in which the (micro)structures as well as the functionality can be disturbed.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder affecting up to 8% of pregnancies. After pre-eclampsia, women are at increased risk of cognitive problems, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disorders. These sequelae could result from microvascular dysfunction persisting after pre-eclampsia. This study will explore differences in cerebral and myocardial microvascular function between women after pre-eclampsia and women after normotensive gestation. We hypothesise that pre-eclampsia alters cerebral and myocardial microvascular functions, which in turn are related to diminished cognitive and cardiac performance. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The cross-sectional 'DEcreased Cognitive functiON, NEurovascular CorrelaTes and myocardial changes in women with a history of pre-eclampsia' (DECONNECT) pilot study includes women after pre-eclampsia and controls after normotensive pregnancy between 6 months and 20 years after gestation. We recruit women from the Queen of Hearts study, a study investigating subclinical heart failure after pre-eclampsia. Neuropsychological tests are employed to assess different cognitive domains, including attention, processing speed, and cognitive control. Cerebral images are recorded using a 7 Tesla MRI to assess blood-brain barrier integrity, perfusion, blood flow, functional and structural networks, and anatomical dimensions. Cardiac images are recorded using a 3 Tesla MRI to assess cardiac perfusion, strain, dimensions, mass, and degree of fibrosis. We assess the effect of a history of pre-eclampsia using multivariable regression analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Ethics Committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre (METC azM/UM, NL47252.068.14). Knowledge dissemination will include scientific publications, presentations at conferences and public forums, and social media. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02347540.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pre-eclampsia, a hypertensive complication of pregnancy, has been associated with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and/or psychological complaints. Signs of an altered brain morphology and more white matter hyperintensities during and shortly after preeclampsia were observed in some, but not all, earlier studies. Here, cerebral volumes, the number of white matter hyperintensities and the age-related effects were compared in formerly pre-eclamptic women and women with normotensive gestational history. METHODS: Structural 7-Tesla magnetic resonance images of the cerebrum were acquired of 59 formerly pre-eclamptic women (aged 37+/-6 years, 0.5-16 years postpartum) and 20 women with normotensive pregnancies (aged 39+/-5 years, 1-18 years postpartum). Fazekas scores were obtained to assess white matter hyperintensity load. Volumes of the whole brain, gray and white matter, brain lobes, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and pericortical CSF were calculated after semi-automatic segmentation. Group differences were analyzed with ANCOVA and Bayes factors. Results were adjusted for age, educational attainment and total intracranial volume. Effects of age on cerebral volumes was analyzed using a linear regression analysis. RESULTS: No changes in global and local brain volumes were observed between formerly pre-eclamptic and control women. Also, no difference in white matter hyperintensity load was observed. Independent of pre-eclamptic history, gray matter volume significantly decreased with age, while ventricular and peri-cortical CSF volumes significantly increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric changes of the cerebrum are age-related, but independent of a pre-eclamptic history in the first two decades after childbirth. No evidence for more white matter lesions after pre-eclampsia was found. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In 30% of the patients with focal epilepsy, an epileptogenic lesion cannot be visually detected with structural MRI. Ultra-high field MRI may be able to identify subtle pathology related to the epileptic focus. We set out to assess 7T MRI-derived volumetric and functional activity lateralization of the hippocampus, hippocampal subfields, temporal and frontal lobe in healthy subjects and MRI-negative patients with focal epilepsy. METHODS: Twenty controls and 10 patients with MRI-negative temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy (TLE and FLE, respectively) underwent a 7T MRI exam. T1 -weigthed imaging and resting-state fMRI was performed. T1 -weighted images were segmented to yield volumes, while from fMRI data, the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations was calculated. Subsequently, volumetric and functional lateralization was calculated from left-right asymmetry. RESULTS: In controls, volumetric lateralization was symmetric, with a slight asymmetry of the hippocampus and subiculum, while functional lateralization consistently showed symmetry. Contrarily, in epilepsy patients, regions were less symmetric. In TLE patients with known focus, volumetric lateralization in the hippocampus and hippocampal subfields was indicative of smaller ipsilateral volumes. These patients also showed clear functional lateralization, though not consistently ipsilateral or contralateral to the epileptic focus. TLE patients with unknown focus showed an obvious volumetric lateralization, facilitating the localization of the epileptic focus. Lateralization results in the FLE patients were less consistent with the epileptic focus. CONCLUSION: MRI-derived volume and fluctuation amplitude are highly symmetric in controls, whereas in TLE, volumetric and functional lateralization effects were observed. This highlights the potential of the technique.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia is a vascular complication of pregnancy with a long-term risk of cerebrovascular and mental disorders. We explored whether differences in functional brain organization are present in formerly preeclamptic women, especially in regions that may explain the generally reported emotional symptoms and cognitive complaints even years after the pregnancy. METHODS: In 55 formerly preeclamptic women and 17 control women with previous normotensive pregnancies, structural and functional 7 Tesla MRI scans were acquired. Using graph theoretical analysis, the efficiency and clustering coefficient of the functional brain network were investigated. Analyses were focused to particular brain structures, i.e. regions of the limbic system and prefrontal cortex, as well as to the global (whole) brain. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate the relation between brain network-related graph measures and pregnancy condition (formerly preeclamptic or control). RESULTS: Former preeclamptic women had higher local efficiency in the prefrontal cortex (p = 0.048) and anterior cingulate cortex (p = 0.03), but a lower local efficiency and local clustering coefficient in the amygdala (p < 0.03) and parahippocampal cortex (p < 0.009) compared to control women with previous normotensive pregnancies. No differences were found in global brain organization. CONCLUSIONS: Formerly preeclamptic women displayed a different local functional organization. These differences in functional connectivity, especially in the limbic regions and prefrontal cortex, are in line with the often expressed psychological and cognitive complaints remaining after a preeclamptic pregnancy.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia, a hypertensive complication of pregnancy, relates to an increased risk of long-term cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. Although the persisting susceptibility to cerebral complications after preeclampsia remains largely unclear, impaired blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is often proposed to precede several cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, we investigated the integrity of the BBB years after preeclampsia. METHODS: We performed cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra-high field (7 Tesla) in 22 formerly preeclamptic women (aged 37.8 +/- 5.4 years, postpartum time 6.6 +/- 3.2 years) and 13 control women with normotensive pregnancies (aged 40.8 +/- 5.5 years, postpartum time 9.0 +/- 3.7 years) to assess the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was determined by assessing leakage rate and fractional leakage volume of a gadolinium-based contrast agent, measured by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Blood-brain barrier leakage measures were determined for the whole brain and lobular white and gray matter. Multivariable analyses were performed and odd's ratios were calculated to compare women with and without preeclampsia, adjusted for potentially confounding effects of age, current hypertension status and Fazekas score. RESULTS: Leakage rate and fractional leakage volume were significantly higher in formerly preeclamptic women compared to control women in the global white (p = 0.001) and gray matter (p = 0.02). Regionally, the frontal (p = 0.04) and parietal cortical gray matter (p = 0.009), and the frontal (p = 0.001), temporal (p = 0.05) and occipital white matter (p = 0.007) showed higher leakage measures in formerly preeclamptic women. The odds of a high leakage rate after preeclampsia were generally higher in white matter regions compared to gray matter regions. CONCLUSION: This observational study shows a globally impaired blood-brain barrier years after a preeclamptic pregnancy, which could be an early marker for long-term cerebrovascular disorders.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) can be employed to assess the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Detection of BBB leakage at lower field strengths (</=3T) is cumbersome as the signal is noisy, while leakage can be subtle. Utilizing the increased signal-to-noise ratio at higher field strengths, we explored the application of 7T DCE-MRI for assessing BBB leakage. METHODS: A dual-time resolution DCE-MRI method was implemented at 7T and a slow injection rate (0.3 ml/s) and low dose (3 mmol) served to obtain signal changes linearly related to the gadolinium concentration, that is, minimized for T2 (*) degradation effects. With the Patlak graphical approach, the leakage rate (Ki ) and blood plasma volume fraction (vp ) were calculated. The method was evaluated in 10 controls, an ischemic stroke patient, and a patient with a transient ischemic attack. RESULTS: Ki and vp were significantly higher in gray matter compared to white matter of all participants. These Ki values were higher in both patients compared to the control subjects. Finally, for the lesion identified in the ischemic stroke patient, higher leakage values were observed compared to normal-appearing tissue. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate how a dual-time resolution DCE-MRI protocol at 7T, with administration of half the clinically used contrast agent dose, can be used for assessing subtle BBB leakage. Although the feasibility of DCE-MRI for assessing the BBB integrity at 3T is well known, we showed that a continuous sampling DCE-MRI method tailored for 7T is also capable of assessing leakage with a high sensitivity over a range of Ki values.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The lack of a robust diagnostic biomarker makes understanding depression from a neurobiological standpoint an important goal, especially in the context of brain imaging. METHODS: In this study, we aim to create novel image-based features for objective diagnosis of depression. Resting-state network time series are used to investigate neurodynamics with the help of wavelet coherence and Granger causality (G-causality). Three new features are introduced: total wavelet coherence, wavelet lead coherence, and wavelet coherence blob analysis. The fourth feature, pair-wise conditional G-causality, is used to establish the causality between resting-state networks. We use the proposed features to classify depression in adult subjects. RESULTS: We obtained an accuracy of 86% in the wavelet lead coherence, 80% in Granger causality, and 86% in wavelet coherence blob analysis. Subjects with depression showed hyperconnectivity between the dorsal attention network and the auditory network as well as between the posterior default mode network and the dorsal attention network. Hypoconnectivity was found between the anterior default mode network and the auditory network as well as the right frontoparietal network and the lateral visual network. An abnormal co-activation pattern was found between cerebellum and the lateral motor network according to the wavelet coherence blob analysis. CONCLUSION: Based on abnormal functional dynamics between brain networks, we were able to identify subjects with depression with high accuracy. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the impaired emotional and attention processing associated with depression, as well as decreased motor activity.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate if single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SV-MRS) can help in lateralising and sometimes in localizing an epileptogenic focus. The assumption is that in MRI negative patients the underlying pathology most often is focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). Several studies have shown that in the presence of FCD there are also (1)H-MRS abnormalities on the contralateral side. However, in most cases the studied group was not homogeneous and included different forms of dysplasias, including band heterotopias and polymicrogyria, and the studies used different spectroscopy protocols. In the present study, using bilateral SV-MRS we investigated the presence of a lateralisation index in two groups of patients with localisation related epilepsy: patients with focal cortical dysplasia on MRI and patients without MRI abnormalities with a focus identified by MEG. Aim of the study was to show that in both groups the expected epileptogenic side shows more pronounced metabolic alterations, making MRS a possible screening tool for clarifying lateralisation questions in patients with cryptogenic localisation related epilepsy. METHODS: In ten patients a single voxel was placed over the FCD and in nine patients over the region of interest (ROI) as indicated by MEG. In all patients a voxel was also placed in the contralateral homologus location. We used metabolite concentrations as peak ratios relative to the creatine (Cr) peak to calculate a lateralisation index. RESULTS: In both groups NAA/Cr was significantly lower on the affected side whereas the results for Cho/Cr were more diverse. There were no significant differences between the two groups. The limitations of the used methods and the implications of the findings are discussed.},

   abstract = {The emergence of COVID-19 was rapidly followed by infection and the deaths of millions of people across the globe. With much of the research and scientific advancement rightly focused on reducing the burden of severe and critical acute COVID-19 infection, the long-term effects endured by those who survived the acute infection has been previously overlooked. Now, an appreciation for the post-COVID-19 condition, including its neurological manifestations, is growing, although there remain many unknowns regarding the aetiology and risk factors of the condition, as well as how to effectively diagnose and treat it. Here, drawing upon the experiences and expertise of the clinicians and academics of the European working group on COVID-19, we have reviewed the current literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the neurological sequalae of the post-COVID-19 condition. In this review, we provide a summary of the neurological symptoms associated with the post-COVID-19 condition, before discussing the possible mechanisms which may underly and manifest these symptoms. Following this, we explore the risk factors for developing neurological symptoms as a result of COVID-19 and the post-COVID-19 condition, as well as how COVID-19 infection may itself be a risk factor for the development of neurological disease in the future. Lastly, we evaluate how the post-COVID condition could be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated, including examples of the current guidelines, clinical outcomes and tools that have been developed to aid in this process, as well as addressing the protection provided by COVID-19 vaccines against post-COVID-19 condition. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the neurological sequalae of the post-COVID-19 condition.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are a frequent cause of drug-resistant epilepsy in children but are often undetected on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aimed to measure and validate the variation of resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) metrics in surgically proven FCDs in children, to assess the potential yield for detecting and understanding these lesions. METHODS: We prospectively included pediatric patients with surgically proven FCD with inconclusive structural MRI and healthy controls, who underwent a ten-minute rs-fMRI acquired at 3T. Rs-fMRI data was pre-processed and maps of values of regional homogeneity (ReHo), degree centrality (DC), amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were calculated. The variations of BOLD metrics within the to-be-resected areas were analyzed visually, and quantitatively using lateralization indices. BOLD metrics variations were also analyzed in fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) hypometabolic areas. RESULTS: We included 7 patients (range: 3-15 years) and 6 aged-matched controls (range: 6-17 years). ReHo lateralization indices were positive in the to-be-resected areas in 4/7 patients, and in 6/7 patients in the additional PET hypometabolic areas. These indices were significantly higher compared to controls in 3/7 and 4/7 patients, respectively. Visual analysis revealed a good spatial correlation between high ReHo areas and MRI structural abnormalities (when present) or PET hypometabolic areas. No consistent variation was seen using DC, ALFF, or fALFF. CONCLUSION: Resting-state fMRI metrics, noticeably increase in ReHo, may have potential to help detect MRI-negative FCDs in combination with other morphological and functional techniques, used in clinical practice and epilepsy-surgery screening.},

   abstract = {In population-based cohort studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for examining brain structure and function. Advanced MRI techniques, such as diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), provide insights into brain connectivity. However, biases in MRI data acquisition and processing can impact brain connectivity measures and their associations with demographic and clinical variables. This study, conducted with 5110 participants from The Maastricht Study, explored the relationship between brain connectivity and various image quality metrics (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, head motion, and atlas-template mismatches) that were obtained from dMRI and rs-fMRI scans. Results revealed that in particular increased head motion (R(2) up to 0.169, p < 0.001) and reduced signal-to-noise ratio (R(2) up to 0.013, p < 0.001) negatively impacted structural and functional brain connectivity, respectively. These image quality metrics significantly affected associations of overall brain connectivity with age (up to -59%), sex (up to -25%), and body mass index (BMI) (up to +14%). Associations with diabetes status, educational level, history of cardiovascular disease, and white matter hyperintensities were generally less affected. This emphasizes the potential confounding effects of image quality in large population-based neuroimaging studies on brain connectivity and underscores the importance of accounting for it.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Differences in brain network connectivity may reflect the capability of the neurological substrate to compensate for brain damage and preserve cognitive function (cognitive reserve). We examined the associations between white matter connectivity, brain damage markers, and cognition in a population sample of middle-aged individuals. METHODS: A total of 4759 participants from The Maastricht Study (mean age = 59.2, SD = 8.7, 50.2% male) underwent cognitive testing and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), from which brain volume, structural connectivity, and vascular damage were quantified. Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate whether connectivity modified the association between brain damage and cognition, adjusted for demographic and cardiometabolic risk factors. RESULTS: More atrophic and vascular brain damage was associated with worse cognition scores. Increasing connectivity moderated the negative association between damage and cognition (chi(2) = 8.64, df = 3, p </= 0.001); individuals with high damage but strong connectivity showed normal cognition. DISCUSSION: Findings support the reserve hypothesis by showing that brain connectivity is associated with cognitive resilience.},

   abstract = {Life-course exposure to risk and protective factors impacts brain macro- and micro-structure, which in turn affects cognition. The concept of brain-age gap assesses brain health by comparing an individual's neuroimaging-based predicted age with their calendar age. A higher BAG implies accelerated brain ageing and is expected to be associated with worse cognition. In this study, we comprehensively modelled mutual associations between brain health and lifestyle factors, brain age and cognition in a large, middle-aged population. For this study, cognitive test scores, lifestyle and 3T MRI data for n = 4881 participants [mean age (+/- SD) = 59.2 (+/-8.6), 50.1% male] were available from The Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort study with extensive phenotyping. Whole-brain volumes (grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid and white matter hyperintensity), cerebral microbleeds and structural white matter connectivity were calculated. Lifestyle factors were combined into an adapted LIfestyle for BRAin health weighted sum score, with higher score indicating greater dementia risk. Cognition was calculated by averaging z-scores across three cognitive domains (memory, information processing speed and executive function and attention). Brain-age gap was calculated by comparing calendar age to predictions from a neuroimaging-based multivariable regression model. Paths between LIfestyle for BRAin health tertiles, brain-age gap and cognitive function were tested using linear regression and structural equation modelling, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical confounders. The results show that cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter, white matter hyperintensity and cerebral microbleeds best predicted brain-age gap (R (2) = 0.455, root mean squared error = 6.44). In regression analysis, higher LIfestyle for BRAin health scores (greater dementia risk) were associated with higher brain-age gap (standardized regression coefficient beta = 0.126, P < 0.001) and worse cognition (beta = -0.046, P = 0.013), while higher brain-age gap was associated with worse cognition (beta=-0.163, P < 0.001). In mediation analysis, 24.7% of the total difference in cognition between the highest and lowest LIfestyle for BRAin health tertile was mediated by brain-age gap (beta (indirect) = -0.049, P < 0.001; beta (total) = -0.198, P < 0.001) and an additional 3.8% was mediated via connectivity (beta (indirect) = -0.006, P < 0.001; beta (total) = -0.150, P < 0.001). Findings suggest that associations between health- and lifestyle-based risk/protective factors (LIfestyle for BRAin health) and cognition can be partially explained by structural brain health markers (brain-age gap) and white matter connectivity markers. Lifestyle interventions targeted at high-risk individuals in mid-to-late life may be effective in promoting and preserving cognitive function in the general public.},

   abstract = {The acquisition of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) data and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of the brain can be integrated into a single measurement, which offers the possibility to determine orientation-dependent (tensorial) perfusion parameters in addition to established IVIM and DTI parameters. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of such a protocol with a clinically feasible scan time below 6 minutes and to use a model-selection approach to find a set of DTI and IVIM tensor parameters that most adequately describes the acquired data. Diffusion-weighted images of the brain were acquired at 3 T in 20 elderly participants with cerebral small vessel disease using a multiband echoplanar imaging sequence with 15 b-values between 0 and 1000 s/mm(2) and 6 noncollinear diffusion gradient directions for each b-value. 7 different IVIM-diffusion models with 4 to 14 parameters were implemented, which modeled diffusion and pseudo-diffusion as scalar or tensor quantities. The models were compared with respect to their fitting performance based on the goodness of fit (sum of squared fit residuals, chi(2) ) and their Akaike weights (calculated from the corrected Akaike information criterion). Lowest chi(2) values were found with the model with the largest number of model parameters. However, significantly highest Akaike weights indicating the most appropriate models for the acquired data were found with a 9-parameter IVIM-DTI model (with isotropic perfusion modeling) in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and with an 11-parameter model (IVIM-DTI with additional pseudo-diffusion anisotropy) in white matter with hyperintensities (WMH) and in gray matter (GM). The latter model allowed for the additional calculation of the fractional anisotropy of the pseudo-diffusion tensor (with a median value of 0.45 in NAWM, 0.23 in WMH, and 0.36 in GM), which is not accessible with the usually performed IVIM acquisitions based on three orthogonal diffusion-gradient directions.},

   abstract = {Introduction: It has been suggested that the development of post-stroke apathy (PSA) and depression (PSD) may be more strongly associated with generalised brain pathology, rather than the stroke lesion itself. The present study aimed to investigate associations between imaging markers of lesion-related and generalised brain pathology and the development of PSA and PSD during a one-year follow-up. Patients and methods: In a prospective cohort study, 188 stroke patients received 3-Tesla MRI at baseline (three months post-stroke) for evaluation of lesion-related, vascular, and degenerative brain pathology. Presence of lacunes, microbleeds, white matter hyperintensities, and enlarged perivascular spaces was summed to provide a measure of total cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) burden (range 0-4). The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Apathy Evaluation Scale were administered at baseline and repeated at 6- and 12-month follow-up to define presence of PSD and PSA, respectively. Results: Population-averaged logistic regression models showed that global brain atrophy and severe cSVD burden (score 3-4) were significantly associated with the odds of having PSA (ORGEE 5.33, 95% CI 1.99-14.25 and 3.04, 95% CI 1.20-7.69, respectively), independent of stroke lesion volume and co-morbid PSD. Medium cSVD burden (score 2) was significantly associated with the odds of having PSD (ORGEE 2.92, 95% CI 1.09-7.78), independent of stroke lesion volume, co-morbid PSA, and pre-stroke depression. No associations were found with lesion-related markers. Conclusions: The results suggest that generalised degenerative and vascular brain pathology, rather than lesion-related pathology, is an important predictor for the development of PSA, and less strongly for PSD.},

   abstract = {Non-invasive quantification of the in vivo myelin content may provide valuable information regarding healthy maturation of the brain, as well as insights into demyelination of several neurological disorders. However, these scans are often long thereby limiting acquisition of large brain parts in clinically feasible acquisition times. Therefore, fast acquisition of whole brain myelin content is important. To avoid errors related to slice-selective pulses, most of the previous whole brain studies on myelin content relied on a 3D acquisition. However, multi-slice (2D) acquisition methods are often faster, and less susceptible to motion artifacts. Therefore, multi-slice approaches can be beneficial in a clinical setting. We investigated the applicability and reproducibility of whole brain multi-slice GRASE myelin-water imaging with post-acquisition slice-profile correction in healthy volunteers (aged 25-32y). The applicability was evaluated using the agreement between the multi-slice GRASE and the reference method for myelin-water imaging, single-slice multi spin-echo (MSE) acquisition. Additionally, we assessed the effect of varying acquisition acceleration using parallel imaging on the reproducibility values. First, the multi-slice myelin-water maps showed good agreement with the single-slice reference method, with a bias of at most 1.2% in absolute MWF values. Second, we found an average within-subject coefficient of variation (CoV) of 5.9% and an average intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.90 for myelin-water estimation using a multi-slice GRASE sequence without parallel acceleration (scan time 14:06min), while acquisition with a parallel acceleration factor of 2 resulted in a slightly worse average within-subject CoV of 6.4% and an average ICC of 0.83at half the scan time. Hence, a multi-slice GRASE acquisition with parallel acceleration factor 2 and a scan time of 7:30min still provides an excellent reproducibility.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: In vivo myelin quantification can provide valuable noninvasive information on neuronal maturation and development, as well as insights into neurological disorders. Multiexponential analysis of multiecho T2 relaxation is a powerful and widely applied method for the quantification of the myelin water fraction (MWF). In recent literature, the MWF is most commonly estimated using a regularized nonnegative least squares algorithm. METHODS: The orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is proposed as an alternative method for the estimation of the MWF. The orthogonal matching pursuit is a greedy sparse reconstruction algorithm with a low computation complexity. For validation, both methods are compared to a ground truth using numerical simulations and a phantom model using comparable computation times. The numerical simulations were used to measure the theoretical errors, as well as the effects of varying the SNR, strength of the regularization, and resolution of the basis set. Additionally, a phantom model was used to estimate the performance of the 2 methods while including errors occurring due to the MR measurement. Lastly, 4 healthy subjects were scanned to evaluate the in vivo performance. RESULTS: The results in simulations and phantoms demonstrate that the MWFs determined with the orthogonal matching pursuit are 1.7 times more accurate as compared to the nonnegative least squares, with a comparable precision. The remaining bias of the MWF is shown to be related to the regularization of the nonnegative least squares algorithm and the Rician noise present in magnitude MR images. CONCLUSION: The orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm provides a more accurate alternative for T2 relaxometry myelin water quantification.},

   abstract = {Myelin is a vital element of normal brain development and structure. Myelination is most prominent during the first two years of life and proceeds until the age of 30. Abnormal myelination is related to several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Recently, abnormal myelin content has also been reported in children with epilepsy. Furthermore, more and more literature hints at a link between abnormal myelination and epilepsy, hence it is worthwhile to evaluate the benefits of non-invasive myelin imaging. In this literature review, we provide an overview of the current evidence of myelin abnormalities in epilepsy from imaging and histological studies. After preselection, 21 histological and 21 in vivo imaging studies were identified. Primarily, epilepsy is found to be associated with a reduced myelin content. This review shows that the currently available literature does not provide a complete view into the nature of myelin abnormalities in epilepsy. However, the reported literature is indicative of a relation between the pathophysiology of epilepsy and the myelin content. More studies that apply myelin-specific imaging techniques are needed to determine whether the myelin abnormalities are an underlying cause of epilepsy, or a consequence of the excessive activity in epilepsy.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Though mediotemporal lobe volume changes are well-known features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), grey matter volume changes may be distributed throughout the brain. These distributed changes are not independent due to the underlying network structure and can be described in terms of a structural covariance network (SCN). OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the cortical brain organization is altered in AD we studied the mutual connectivity of hubs in the SCN, i.e., the rich-club. METHODS: To construct the SCNs, cortical thickness was obtained from structural MRI for 97 participants (normal cognition, n = 37; mild cognitive impairment, n = 41; Alzheimer-type dementia, n = 19). Subsequently, rich-club coefficients were calculated from the SCN, and related to memory performance and hippocampal volume using linear regression. RESULTS: Lower rich-club connectivity was related to lower memory performance as well as lower hippocampal volume. CONCLUSION: Therefore, this study provides novel evidence of reduced connectivity in hub areas in relation to AD-related cognitive impairments and atrophy.},

   abstract = {Myelin is vital for healthy neuronal development, and can therefore provide valuable information regarding neuronal maturation. Anatomical and diffusion weighted images (DWI) possess information related to the myelin content and the current study investigates whether quantitative myelin markers can be extracted from anatomical and DWI using neural networks. Thirteen volunteers (mean age 29y) are included, and for each subject, a residual neural network was trained using spatially undersampled reference myelin-water markers. The network is trained on a voxel-by-voxel basis, resulting in a large amount of training data for each volunteer. The inputs used are the anatomical contrasts (cT1w, cT2w), the standardized T1w/T2w ratio, estimates of the relaxation times (T1, T2) and their ratio (T1/T2), and common DWI metrics (FA, RD, MD, lambda1, lambda2, lambda3). Furthermore, to estimate the added value of the DWI metrics, neural networks were trained using either the combined set (DWI, T1w and T2w) or only the anatomical (T1w and T2w) images. The reconstructed myelin-water maps are in good agreement with the reference myelin-water content in terms of the coefficient of variation (CoV) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A 6-fold undersampling using both anatomical and DWI metrics resulted in ICC = 0.68 and CoV = 5.9%. Moreover, using twice the training data (3-fold undersampling) resulted in an ICC that is comparable to the reproducibility of the myelin-water imaging itself (CoV = 5.5% vs. CoV = 6.7% and ICC = 0.74 vs ICC = 0.80). To achieve this, beside the T1w, T2w images, DWI is required. This preliminary study shows the potential of machine learning approaches to extract specific myelin-content from anatomical and diffusion-weighted scans.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The brains of patients with epilepsy may exhibit various morphological abnormalities, which are often not directly visible on structural MR images, as they may be focally subtle or related to a more large-scale inconspicuous disorganization of brain structures. To explore the relation between structural brain organization and epilepsy characteristics, including severity and cognitive co-morbidity, we determined structural covariance networks (SCNs). SCNs represent interregional correlations of morphologic measures, for instance in terms of cortical thickness, between various large-scale distributed brain regions. METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with focal seizures of all subtypes and 21 healthy controls underwent structural MRI, neurological, and IQ assessment. Cortical thickness was derived from the structural MRIs using FreeSurfer. Subsequently, SCNs were constructed on a group-level based on correlations of the cortical thicknesses between various brain regions. Individual SCNs for the epilepsy patients were extracted by adding the respective patient to the control group prior to the SCN construction (i.e. add-one-patient approach). Calculated network measures, i.e. path length, clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality were correlated with characteristics related to the severity of epilepsy, including seizure history and age at onset of epilepsy, and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Stronger clustering in the individual SCN was associated with a higher number of focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures during life time, a younger age at onset, and lower cognitive performance. The path length of the individual SCN was not related to the severity of epilepsy or cognitive performance. Higher betweenness centrality of the left cuneus and lower betweenness centrality of the right rostral middle frontal gyrus were associated with increased drug load and younger age at onset, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the correlations between interregional variations of cortical thickness reflect disease characteristics or responses to the disease and deficits in patients with epilepsy with focal seizures.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that alterations in excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitters might play a crucial role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) can provide valuable information about abnormal brain metabolism and neurotransmitter concentrations. However, few (1)H-MRS studies have been published on the imbalance of the two most abundant neurotransmitters in ASD: glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Moreover, to our knowledge none of these published studies is performed with a study population consisting purely of high-functioning autism (HFA) adolescents. Selecting only individuals with HFA eliminates factors possibly related to intellectual impairment instead of ASD. This study aims to assess Glu and GABA neurotransmitter concentrations in HFA. Occipital concentrations of Glu and GABA plus macromolecules (GABA+) were obtained using (1)H-MRS relative to creatine (Cr) in adolescents with HFA (n=15 and n=13 respectively) and a healthy control group (n=17). Multiple linear regression revealed significantly higher Glu/Cr and lower GABA+/Glu concentrations in the HFA group compared to the controls. These results imply that imbalanced neurotransmitter levels of excitation and inhibition are associated with HFA in adolescents.},

   abstract = {Interstitial fluid (ISF) refers to the fluid between the parenchymal cells and along the perivascular spaces (PVS). ISF plays a crucial role in delivering nutrients and clearing waste products from the brain. This narrative review focuses on the use of MRI techniques to measure various ISF characteristics in humans. The complementary value of contrast-enhanced and noncontrast-enhanced techniques is highlighted. While contrast-enhanced MRI methods allow measurement of ISF transport and flow, they lack quantitative assessment of ISF properties. Noninvasive MRI techniques, including multi-b-value diffusion imaging, free-water-imaging, T(2) -decay imaging, and DTI along the PVS, offer promising alternatives to derive ISF measures, such as ISF volume and diffusivity. The emerging role of these MRI techniques in investigating ISF alterations in neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) and cerebrovascular diseases (eg, cerebral small vessel disease and stroke) is discussed. This review also emphasizes current challenges of ISF imaging, such as the microscopic scale at which ISF has to be measured, and discusses potential focus points for future research to overcome these challenges, for example, the use of high-resolution imaging techniques. Noninvasive MRI methods for measuring ISF characteristics hold significant potential and may have a high clinical impact in understanding the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders, as well as in evaluating the efficacy of ISF-targeted therapies in clinical trials.

   abstract = {While cognitive impairments are not generally considered to be part of the childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) syndrome, some recent studies report cognitive, mainly attentional, deficits. Here we set out to investigate the whole brain functional network of children with CAE and controls. Furthermore, the possible relation of the functional network abnormalities with epilepsy and neurocognitive characteristics is studied. Seventeen children with childhood CAE (aged 9.2+/-2.1 years) and 15 controls (aged 9.8+/-1.8 years) were included. Resting state functional MRI was acquired to study the functional network. Using graph theoretical analysis, three global metrics of the functional network were investigated: the characteristic path length, the clustering coefficient, and the small-worldness. A multivariable linear regression model including age, sex, and subject motion as covariates was used to investigate group differences in the graph metrics. Subsequently, relations of the graph metrics with epilepsy and neurocognitive characteristics were assessed. Longer path lengths, weaker clustering and a lower small-world network topology were observed in children with CAE compared to controls. Moreover, longer path lengths were related to a longer duration of CAE and a higher number of absence seizure per hour. Clustering and small-worldness were not significantly related to epilepsy or neurocognitive characteristics. The organization of the functional network of children with CAE is less efficient compared to controls, and is related to disease duration. These preliminary findings suggest that CAE is associated with alterations in the functional network.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The process of myelination starts in utero around 20 weeks of gestation and continues through adulthood. We first set out to characterize the maturation of the tract-specific myelin content in healthy subjects from childhood (7-12 years) into adulthood (18-32 years). Second, we apply the resulting development graph to children with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), a pediatric epilepsy that was previously characterized by changes in myelin content. METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 15 healthy children (7-12 years), 14 healthy adult participants (18-32 years) and 17 children with a clinical diagnosis of CAE (6-12 years) were included. For each participant, diffusion weighted images were acquired to reconstruct bundles of white matter tracts and multi-echo multi-slice GRASE images were acquired for myelin-water estimation. Subsequently, a tract-specific myelin development graph was constructed using the percentual difference in myelin-water content from childhood (12 year) to adulthood (25 year). RESULTS: The graph revealed myelination patterns, where tracts in the central regions myelinate prior to peripheral tracts and intra-hemispheric tracts as well as tracts in the left hemisphere myelinate prior to inter-hemispheric tracts and tracts in the right hemisphere, respectively. No significant differences were found in myelin-water content between children with CAE and healthy children for neither the early developing tracts, nor the tracts that develop in a later stage. However, the difference between the myelin-water of late and early developing tracts is significantly smaller in the children with CAE. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that CAE is associated with widespread neurodevelopmental myelin differences.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The frontal lobe in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) might be affected due to the suggested involvement of the frontal lobe during absence seizures and reports on attentional deficits. Previously, subtle white matter abnormalities have been reported in CAE. However, the impact of one of the most characteristic components of the white matter, the myelin content, remains underdetermined. Therefore, this study investigated whether the myelin content in frontal areas is adversely affected in CAE compared to controls. METHODS: Seventeen children with childhood absence epilepsy (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD], 9.2 +/- 2.1 years) and 15 age- and sex-matched controls (mean age +/- SD, 9.8 +/- 1.8 years) underwent neuropsychological assessment and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. T2 relaxometry scans were used to distinguish myelin-water from tissue water and to determine the myelin-water fraction (MWF) in the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and insular lobes. A linear regression model including age and sex as covariates was used to investigate group differences. Furthermore, the relationship of MWF with cognitive performance and epilepsy characteristics was determined. RESULTS: The frontal lobe revealed a significantly lower myelin-water content in children with CAE compared to controls over the developmental age range of 6-12 years (5.7 +/- 1.0% vs 6.6 +/- 1.1%, P = 0.02). This association was not found for any of the other four lobes (P > 0.10). No significant relation was found between myelin-water content and cognitive performance or epilepsy characteristics. SIGNIFICANCE: The lower frontal myelin-water content of children with CAE in comparison with healthy controls probably reflects an altered neurodevelopmental aspect in CAE, of which the underlying mechanisms still need to be unraveled.},

   abstract = {It is often difficult to predict seizure recurrence in subjects who have suffered a first-ever epileptic seizure. In this study, the predictive value of physiological signals measured using Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) is assessed. In particular those patients developing epilepsy (i.e. a second unprovoked seizure) that were initially evaluated as having a low risk of seizure recurrence are of interest. In total, 26 epilepsy patients, of which 8 were initially evaluated as having a low risk of seizure recurrence (i.e. converters), and 17 subjects with only a single seizure were included. All subjects underwent routine EEG as well as fMRI measurements. For diagnostic classification, features related to the temporal dynamics were determined for both the processed EEG and fMRI data. Subsequently, a logistic regression classifier was trained on epilepsy and first-seizure subjects. The trained model was tested using the clinically relevant converters group. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (mean+/-SD) of the regression model including metrics from both modalities were 74+/-19%, 82+/-18%, and 0.75+/-0.12, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values (mean+/-SD) of the regression model with both EEG and fMRI features are 84+/-14% and 78+/-12%. Moreover, this EEG/fMRI model showed significant improvements compared to the clinical diagnosis, whereas the models using metrics from either EEG or fMRI do not reach significance (p>0.05). Temporal metrics computationally derived from EEG and fMRI time signals may clinically aid and synergistically improve the predictive value in a first-seizure sample.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Multi-b-value diffusion-weighted MRI techniques can simultaneously measure the parenchymal diffusivity, microvascular perfusion, and a third, intermediate diffusion component. This component is related to the interstitial fluid in the brain parenchyma. However, simultaneously estimating three diffusion components from multi-b-value data is difficult and has strong dependence on SNR and chosen b-values. As the number of acquired b-values is limited due to scanning time, it is important to know which b-values are most effective to be included. Therefore, this study evaluates an optimized b-value sampling for interstitial fluid estimation. METHOD: The optimized b-value sampling scheme is determined using a genetic algorithm. Subsequently, the performance of this optimized sampling is assessed by comparing it with a linear, logarithmic, and previously proposed sampling scheme, in terms of the RMS error (RMSE) for the intermediate component estimation. The in vivo performance of the optimized sampling is assessed using 7T data with 101 equally spaced b-values ranging from 0 to 1000 s/mm(2) . In this case, the RMSE was determined by comparing the fit that includes all b-values. RESULTS: The optimized b-value sampling for estimating the intermediate component was reported to be [0, 30, 90, 210, 280, 350, 580, 620, 660, 680, 720, 760, 980, 990, 1000] s/mm(2) . For computer simulations, the optimized sampling had a lower RMSE, compared with the other samplings for varying levels of SNR. For the in vivo data, the voxel-wise RMSE of the optimized sampling was lower compared with other sampling schemes. CONCLUSION: The genetic algorithm-optimized b-value scheme improves the quantification of the diffusion component related to interstitial fluid in terms of a lower RMSE.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the available evidence regarding the association between these factors and cerebral macro- and microstructure. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in various databases, following predefined criteria. Heterogeneity, risk of publication bias and overall certainty of evidence were assessed using standardized scales and, whenever appropriate, random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Of 6,715 identified articles, 43 were included. Overall, consistency of findings was low and methodological heterogeneity high for all outcomes. However, in some studies cognitive and social activities were positively associated with total brain, global and cortical grey matter and hippocampal volume as well as white matter microstructural integrity. Furthermore, structural social network characteristics (e.g., social network size) were associated with regional grey matter volumes, while functional social network characteristics (e.g., social support) were additionally associated with total brain volume. Meta-analyses revealed small but significant partial correlations between cognitive and social activities and hippocampal (three studies; n=892; r(z)=.07) and white matter hyperintensity volume (three studies; n=2934; r(z)=-.04). More prospective studies are needed to assess temporal associations.},

Dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI is sensitive to both blood perfusion and BBB leakage, and correction methods may be crucial for obtaining reliable perfusion measures. These methods might also be applicable to detect BBB leakage itself. This study investigated to what extent DSC-MRI can measure subtle BBB leakage in a clinical feasibility setting. METHODS: In vivo DCE and DSC data were collected from fifteen cSVD patients (71 (+/-10) years, 6F/9M) and twelve elderly controls (71 (+/-10) years, 4F/8M). DSC-derived leakage fractions were obtained using the Boxerman-Schmainda-Weisskoff method (K2). K2 was compared with the DCE-derived leakage rate K(i), obtained from Patlak analysis. Subsequently, differences were assessed between white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cortical gray matter (CGM), and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Additionally, computer simulations were performed to assess the sensitivity of DSC-MRI to BBB leakage. RESULTS: K2 showed significant differences between tissue regions (P < 0.001 for CGM-NAWM and CGM-WMH, and P = 0.001 for NAWM-WMH). Conversely, according to the computer simulations the DSC sensitivity was insufficient to measure subtle BBB leakage, as the K2 values were below the derived limit of quantification (4∙10(-3) min(-1)). As expected, K(i) was elevated in the WMH compared to CGM and NAWM (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical DSC-MRI seems capable to detect subtle BBB leakage differences between WMH and normal-appearing brain tissue it is not recommended. K2 as a direct measure for subtle BBB leakage remains ambiguous as its signal effects are due to mixed T(1)- and T(2)( *)-weighting. Further research is warranted to better disentangle perfusion from leakage effects.},

   abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the interface between the blood and brain tissue, which regulates the maintenance of homeostasis within the brain. Impaired BBB integrity is increasingly associated with various neurological diseases. To gain a better understanding of the underlying processes involved in BBB breakdown, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are highly suitable for noninvasive BBB assessment. Commonly used MRI techniques to assess BBB integrity are dynamic contrast-enhanced and dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, both relying on leakage of gadolinium-based contrast agents. A number of conceptually different methods exist that target other aspects of the BBB. These alternative techniques make use of endogenous markers, such as water and glucose, as contrast media. A comprehensive overview of currently available MRI techniques to assess the BBB condition is provided from a scientific point of view, including potential applications in disease. Improvements that are required to make these techniques clinically more easily applicable will also be discussed.},

   abstract = {Perfusion measures of the total vasculature are commonly derived with gradient-echo (GE) dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR images, which are acquired during the early passes of a contrast agent. Alternatively, spin-echo (SE) DSC can be used to achieve specific sensitivity to the capillary signal. For an improved contrast-to-noise ratio, ultra-high-field MRI makes this technique more appealing to study cerebral microvascular physiology. Therefore, this study assessed the applicability of SE-DSC MRI at 7 T. Forty-one elderly adults underwent 7 T MRI using a multi-slice SE-EPI DSC sequence. The cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were determined in the cortical grey matter (CGM) and white matter (WM) and compared to values from the literature. The relation of CBV and CBF with age and sex was investigated. Higher CBV and CBF values were found in CGM compared to WM, whereby the CGM-to-WM ratios depended on the amount of largest vessels excluded from the analysis. CBF was negatively associated with age in the CGM, while no significant association was found with CBV. Both CBV and CBF were higher in women compared to men in both CGM and WM. The current study verifies the possibility of quantifying cerebral microvascular perfusion with SE-DSC MRI at 7 T.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The development of post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is related to a worse clinical outcome in stroke patients. Adding a biomarker to the clinical diagnostic process for the prediction of PSE may help to establish targeted and personalized treatment for high-risk patients, which could lead to improved patient outcomes. We assessed the added value of a risk assessment and subsequent targeted treatment by conducting an early Health Technology Assessment. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with four relevant stakeholders in the field of PSE to obtain a realistic view of the current healthcare and their opinions on the potential value of a PSE risk assessment and subsequent targeted treatment. The consequences on quality of life and costs of current care of a hypothetical care pathway with perfect risk assessment were modeled based on information from a literature review and the input from the stakeholders. Subsequently, the maximum added value (the headroom) was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of this result to variation in assumed input parameters, i.e. the accuracy of the risk assessment, the efficacy of anti-seizure medication (ASM), and the probability of patients expected to develop PSE. RESULTS: All stakeholders considered the addition of a predictive biomarker for the risk assessment of PSE to be of value. The headroom amounted to euro12,983. The sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the headroom remained beneficial when varying the accuracy of the risk assessment, the ASM efficacy, and the number of patients expected to develop PSE. DISCUSSION: We showed that a risk assessment for PSE development is potentially valuable. This work demonstrates that it is worthwhile to undertake clinical studies to evaluate biomarkers for the prediction of patients at high risk for PSE and to assess the value of targeted prophylactic treatment.},

   abstract = {Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a generalized pediatric epilepsy, which is generally considered to be a benign condition since most children become seizure-free before reaching adulthood. However, cognitive deficits and changes of brain morphological have been previously reported in CAE. These morphological changes, even if they might be very subtle, are not independent due to the underlying network structure and can be captured by the structural covariance network (SCN). In this study, SCNs were used to quantify the structural brain network for children with CAE as well as controls. Seventeen children with CAE (6-12y) and fifteen controls (6-12y) were included. To estimate the SCN, T1-weighted images were acquired and parcellated into 68 cortical regions. Graph measures characterizing the core network architecture, i.e. the assortativity and rich-club coefficient, were calculated for all individuals. Multivariable linear regression models, including age and sex as covariates, were used to assess differences between children with CAE and controls. Additionally, potential relations between the core network and cognitive performance was investigated. A lower assortativity (i.e. less efficiently organized core network organization) was found for children with CAE compared to controls. Moreover, better cognitive performance was found to relate to stronger assortative mixing pattern (i.e. more efficient core network structure). Rich-club coefficients did not differ between groups, nor relate to cognitions. The core network organization of the SCN in children with CAE tend to be less efficient organized compared to controls, and relates to cognitive performance, and therefore this study provides novel insights into the SCN organization in relation to CAE and cognition.},

   abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition often co-exist in (prodromal) dementia, and both types of pathology have been associated with neurodegeneration. We examined whether cSVD and Abeta have independent or interactive effects on hippocampal volume (HV) in a memory clinic population. We included 87 individuals with clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 24), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 26), and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) (n = 37). cSVD magnetic resonance imaging markers included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, lacunar infarct presence, and microbleed presence. Abeta pathology was assessed as cerebrospinal fluid-derived Abeta1 - 42 levels and dichotomized into normal or abnormal, and HV was determined by manual volumetric measurements. A linear hierarchical regression approach was applied for the detection of additive or interaction effects between cSVD and Abeta on HV in the total participant group (n = 87) and in the non-demented group (including SCC and MCI individuals only, n = 63). The results revealed that abnormal Abeta and lacunar infarct presence were independently associated with lower HV in the non-demented individuals. Interestingly, Abeta and WMH pathology interacted in the non-demented individuals, such that WMH had a negative effect on HV in individuals with abnormal CSF Abeta42 levels, but not in individuals with normal CSF Abeta42 levels. These associations were not present when individuals with AD were included in the analyses. Our observations suggest that relatively early on in the disease process older individuals with abnormal Abeta levels are at an increased risk of accelerated disease progression when concomitant cSVD is present.},

The objective of this study was to examine associations between BBB leakage, cSVD, neurodegeneration, and cognitive performance across the spectrum from normal cognition to dementia. Leakage was measured with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in 80 older participants (normal cognition, n = 32; mild cognitive impairment, n = 34; clinical AD-type dementia, n = 14). Associations between leakage and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, hippocampal volume, and cognition (information processing speed and memory performance) were examined with multivariable linear regression and mediation analyses. Leakage within the gray and white matter was positively associated with WMH volume (gray matter, p = 0.03; white matter, p = 0.01). A negative association was found between white matter BBB leakage and information processing speed performance, which was mediated by WMH volume. Leakage was not associated with hippocampal volume. WMH pathology is suggested to form a link between leakage and decline of information processing speed in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Breakdown of BBB integrity occurs in dementia and may lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. We assessed whether extravasation of gadolinium chelate could be visualized on delayed postcontrast FLAIR images in older individuals with and without cognitive impairment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four individuals participated in this study (15 with Alzheimer disease, 33 with mild cognitive impairment, and 26 with normal cognition). We assessed the appearance of pericortical enhancement after contrast administration, MR imaging markers of cerebrovascular damage, and medial temporal lobe atrophy. Three participants who were positive for pericortical enhancement (1 with normal cognition and 2 with mild cognitive impairment) were followed up for approximately 2 years. In vitro experiments with a range of gadolinium concentrations served to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the postcontrast FLAIR signals. RESULTS: Postcontrast pericortical enhancement was observed in 21 participants (28%), including 6 individuals with Alzheimer disease (40%), 10 with mild cognitive impairment (30%), and 5 with normal cognition (19%). Pericortical enhancement was positively associated with age (P < .02) and ischemic stroke (P < .05), but not with cognitive status (P = .3). Foci with enhanced signal remained stable across time in all follow-up cases. The in vitro measurements confirmed that FLAIR imaging is highly sensitive for the detection of low gadolinium concentrations in CSF, but not in cerebral tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast pericortical enhancement on FLAIR images occurs in older individuals with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. It may represent chronic focal superficial BBB leakage. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine its clinical significance.},

   abstract = {Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enhancement on T2-weighted post-contrast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (pcT2wFLAIR) images is a relatively unknown neuroradiological marker for gadolinium-based contrast agent extravasation due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We systematically reviewed human studies reporting on CSF enhancement on pcT2wFLAIR images to provide a comprehensive overview of prevalence of this new biomarker in healthy and diseased populations as well as its etiology and optimal detection methodology. We extracted information on the prevalence of CSF enhancement, its vascular risk factor and neuroimaging correlates, and methodological attributes of each study. Forty-four eligible studies were identified. By pooling data, we found that the prevalence of CSF enhancement was 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 80-89) in meningitis (4 studies, 65 patients), 73% (95%CI 62-81) in cases with (post-) acute intracerebral hemorrhage (2 studies, 77 cases), 64% (95% CI 54-73) in cases who underwent surgery for aneurysm treatment (2 studies, 99 patients), 40% (95% CI 30-51) in cases who underwent surgery for carotid artery disease treatment (3 studies, 76 patients), 27% (95% CI 25-30) in cases with acute ischemic stroke (9 studies, 1148 patients), 21% (95% CI 17-23) in multiple sclerosis (6 studies, 897 patients), and 13% (95% CI 7-21) in adult controls (4 studies, 112 cases). Presence of CSF enhancement was associated with higher age in eleven studies, with lobar cerebral microbleeds in one study, and with cerebral atrophy in four studies. PcT2wFLAIR imaging represents a promising method that can provide novel perspectives on BBB leakage into CSF compartments, with the potential to reveal important new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of varying neurological diseases.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and neurodegeneration may be involved in the development and persistence of late-life depressive symptoms, but longitudinal evidence is scarce. We investigated the longitudinal associations of markers of CSVD and brain atrophy with incident depressive symptoms and the course of depressive symptoms, above and below 60 years of age. METHODS: White matter hyperintensity volumes (WMH), presence of lacunar infarcts and cerebral microbleeds, and white matter, grey matter, and cerebral spinal fluid volumes were assessed at baseline by 3T MRI in The Maastricht Study (mean age 59.5+/-8.5 years, 49.6% women, n=4,347; 16,535 person-years of follow-up). Clinically relevant depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire>/=10) were assessed at baseline and annually over seven years. We used Cox regression and multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for demographic, cardiovascular, and lifestyle risk factors. RESULTS: Above 60 years of age, larger WMH volumes were associated with an increased risk for incident depressive symptoms (HR[95%CI]:1.24[1.04;1.48] per SD) and a persistent course of depressive symptoms (OR:1.44[1.04;2.00] per SD). Total CSVD burden was associated with persistent depressive symptoms irrespective of age (adjusted OR:1.58[1.03;2.43]), while no associations were found for general markers of brain atrophy. LIMITATIONSS: Our findings need replication in other large-scale population-based studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may suggest a temporal association of larger WMH volume with the incidence and persistence of late-life depression in the general population and may provide a potential target for the prevention of chronic late-life depression.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Altered white matter brain connectivity has been linked to depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of markers of white matter connectivity with prevalence, incidence and course of depressive symptoms. METHODS: Markers of white matter connectivity (node degree, clustering coefficient, local efficiency, characteristic path length, and global efficiency) were assessed at baseline by 3 T MRI in the population-based Maastricht Study (n = 4866; mean +/- standard deviation age 59.6 +/- 8.5 years, 49.0% women; 17 406 person-years of follow-up). Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9) were assessed at baseline and annually over seven years of follow-up. Major depressive disorder (MDD) was assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview at baseline only. We used negative binominal, logistic and Cox regression analyses, and adjusted for demographic, cardiovascular, and lifestyle risk factors. RESULTS: A lower global average node degree at baseline was associated with the prevalence and persistence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms [PHQ-9 10; OR (95% confidence interval) per standard deviation = 1.21 (1.05-1.39) and OR = 1.21 (1.02-1.44), respectively], after full adjustment. On the contrary, no associations were found of global average node degree with the MDD at baseline [OR 1.12 (0.94-1.32) nor incidence or remission of clinically relevant depressive symptoms [HR = 1.05 (0.95-1.17) and OR 1.08 (0.83-1.41), respectively]. Other connectivity measures of white matter organization were not associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that fewer white matter connections may contribute to prevalent depressive symptoms and its persistence but not to incident depression. Future studies are needed to replicate our findings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with depression often show an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile and might represent a distinct depression subtype. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a cardiometabolic depression subtype could be identified and to investigate its association with demographics and clinical characteristics (severity, symptomatology, anti-depressant use, persistence and cognitive functioning). METHODS: We used data from The Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort in the southern part of The Netherlands. A total of 248 participants with major depressive disorder were included (mean [SD] age, 58.8+/-8.5years; 121 [48.8%] were men). Major depressive disorder was assessed at baseline by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Cardiometabolic risk factors were defined as indicators of the metabolic syndrome according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. We measured severity and persistence of depressive symptoms by use of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: Latent class analysis resulted in two subtypes, one with cardiometabolic depression (n=145) and another with non-cardiometabolic depression (n=103). The cardiometabolic depression subtype was characterized by being male, low education, more severe depressive symptoms, less symptoms of depressed mood and more symptoms of loss of energy, more use of antidepressant medication and lower cognitive functioning. LIMITATIONS: No conclusions can be made about causality. CONCLUSIONS: Latent class analysis suggested a distinct cardiometabolic depression subtype. Participants with cardiometabolic depression differed from participants with non-cardiometabolic depression in terms of demographics and clinical characteristics. The existence of a cardiometabolic depression subtype may indicate the need for prevention and treatment targeting cardiometabolic risk management.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic inequalities in cognitive impairment may partly act through structural brain damage and reduced connectivity. This study investigated the extent to which the association of early-life socioeconomic position (SEP) with later-life cognitive functioning is mediated by later-life SEP, and whether the associations of SEP with later-life cognitive functioning can be explained by structural brain damage and connectivity. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the Dutch population-based Maastricht Study (n = 4,839; mean age 59.2 +/- 8.7 years, 49.8% women). Early-life SEP was assessed by self-reported poverty during childhood and parental education. Later-life SEP included education, occupation, and current household income. Participants underwent cognitive testing and 3-T magnetic resonance imaging to measure volumes of white matter hyperintensities, grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and structural connectivity. Multiple linear regression analyses tested the associations between SEP, markers of structural brain damage and connectivity, and cognitive functioning. Mediation was tested using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Although there were direct associations between both indicators of SEP and later-life cognitive functioning, a large part of the association between early-life SEP and later-life cognitive functioning was explained by later-life SEP (72.2%). The extent to which structural brain damage or connectivity acted as mediators between SEP and cognitive functioning was small (up to 5.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We observed substantial SEP differences in later-life cognitive functioning. Associations of structural brain damage and connectivity with cognitive functioning were relatively small, and only marginally explained the SEP gradients in cognitive functioning.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with depression often experience widespread and persistent cognitive deficits, which might be due to brain atrophy and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). We therefore studied the associations between depression, markers of brain atrophy and CSVD, and cognitive functioning. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the population-based Maastricht study (n = 4734; mean age 59.1 +/- 8.6 years, 50.2% women), which focuses on type 2 diabetes. A current episode of major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 151) was assessed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Volumes of cerebral spinal fluid, white matter, gray matter and white matter hyperintensities, presence of lacunar infarcts and cerebral microbleeds, and total CSVD burden were assessed by 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses tested the associations between MDD, brain markers and cognitive functioning in memory, information processing speed, and executive functioning & attention, and presence of cognitive impairment. Structural equation modeling was used to test mediation. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, MDD was associated with lower scores in information processing speed [mean difference = -0.18(-0.28;-0.08)], executive functioning & attention [mean difference = -0.13(-0.25;-0.02)], and with higher odds of cognitive impairment [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60(1.06;2.40)]. MDD was associated with CSVD in participants without type 2 diabetes [OR = 1.65(1.06;2.56)], but CSVD or other markers of brain atrophy or CSVD did not mediate the association with cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: MDD is associated with more impaired information processing speed and executive functioning & attention, and overall cognitive impairment. Furthermore, MDD was associated with CSVD in participants without type 2 diabetes, but this association did not explain an impaired cognitive profile.},

   abstract = {In many brain diseases it can be qualitatively observed that spatial patterns in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation maps appear more (diffusively) distributed than in healthy controls. However, measures that can quantitatively characterize this spatial distributiveness in individual subjects are lacking. In this study, we propose a number of spatial heterogeneity measures to characterize brain activation maps. The proposed methods focus on different aspects of heterogeneity, including the shape (compactness), complexity in the distribution of activated regions (fractal dimension and co-occurrence matrix), and gappiness between activated regions (lacunarity). To this end, functional MRI derived activation maps of a language and a motor task were obtained in language impaired children with (Rolandic) epilepsy and compared to age-matched healthy controls. Group analysis of the activation maps revealed no significant differences between patients and controls for both tasks. However, for the language task the activation maps in patients appeared more heterogeneous than in controls. Lacunarity was the best measure to discriminate activation patterns of patients from controls (sensitivity 74%, specificity 70%) and illustrates the increased irregularity of gaps between activated regions in patients. The combination of heterogeneity measures and a support vector machine approach yielded further increase in sensitivity and specificity to 78% and 80%, respectively. This illustrates that activation distributions in impaired brains can be complex and more heterogeneous than in normal brains and cannot be captured fully by a single quantity. In conclusion, heterogeneity analysis has potential to robustly characterize the increased distributiveness of brain activation in individual patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Focal cortical dysplasia is a common cause of intractable epilepsy for which neurosurgery is an option. Delineations of a focal cortical dysplasia lesion on structural brain images may not necessarily reflect the functional borders of normal tissue. Our objective was to determine whether abnormalities in spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations arise in focal cortical dysplasia lesions and proximal regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with focal cortical dysplasia-related epilepsy and 16 healthy controls underwent structural and resting-state functional MR imaging. Three known blood oxygen level-dependent measures were determined, including the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and wavelet entropy. These measures were evaluated in the lesion and perilesional zone and normalized to the contralateral cortex of patients with focal cortical dysplasia and healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients showed significantly decreased fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and increased wavelet entropy in the focal cortical dysplasia lesion and the perilesional zone (</=2 cm) relative to the contralateral homotopic cortex and the same regions in healthy controls. Regional homogeneity was significantly increased in the focal cortical dysplasia lesion compared with the contralateral homotopic cortex and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations were seen up to 2 cm distant from the radiologically visible boundary. It was demonstrated that functional boundaries go beyond structural boundaries of focal cortical dysplasia lesions. Validation is required to reveal whether this information is valuable for surgical planning and outcome evaluation of focal cortical dysplasia lesions and comparing current results with electrophysiologic analysis.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the wavelet entropy for the characterization of intrinsic aberrant temporal irregularities in the time series of resting-state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. Further, to evaluate the temporal irregularities (disorder/order) on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BOLD time series was decomposed using the discrete wavelet transform and the wavelet entropy was calculated. Using a model time series consisting of multiple harmonics and nonstationary components, the wavelet entropy was compared with Shannon and spectral (Fourier-based) entropy. As an application, the wavelet entropy in 22 children with Rolandic epilepsy was compared to 22 age-matched healthy controls. The images were obtained by performing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using a 3T system, an 8-element receive-only head coil, and an echo planar imaging pulse sequence ( T2*-weighted). The wavelet entropy was also compared to spectral entropy, regional homogeneity, and Shannon entropy. RESULTS: Wavelet entropy was found to identify the nonstationary components of the model time series. In Rolandic epilepsy patients, a significantly elevated wavelet entropy was observed relative to controls for the whole cerebrum (P = 0.03). Spectral entropy (P = 0.41), regional homogeneity (P = 0.52), and Shannon entropy (P = 0.32) did not reveal significant differences. CONCLUSION: The wavelet entropy measure appeared more sensitive to detect abnormalities in cerebral fluctuations represented by nonstationary effects in the BOLD time series than more conventional measures. This effect was observed in the model time series as well as in Rolandic epilepsy. These observations suggest that the brains of children with Rolandic epilepsy exhibit stronger nonstationary temporal signal fluctuations than controls.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of epilepsy cannot be reliably made prior to a patient's second seizure in most cases. Therefore, adequate diagnostic tools are needed to differentiate subjects with a first seizure from those with a seizure preceding the onset of epilepsy. The objective was to explore spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations in subjects with a first-ever seizure and patients with new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and to find characteristic biomarkers for seizure recurrence after the first seizure. METHODS: We examined 17 first-seizure subjects, 19 patients with new-onset epilepsy (NOE), and 18 healthy controls. All subjects underwent clinical investigation and received electroencephalography and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The BOLD time series were analyzed in terms of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFFs). RESULTS: We found significantly stronger amplitudes (higher fALFFs) in patients with NOE relative to first-seizure subjects and healthy controls. The frequency range of 73-198 mHz (slow-3 subband) appeared most useful for discriminating patients with NOE from first-seizure subjects. The ReHo measure did not show any significant differences. SIGNIFICANCE: The fALFF appears to be a noninvasive measure that characterizes spontaneous BOLD fluctuations and shows stronger amplitudes in the slow-3 subband of patients with NOE relative first-seizure subjects and healthy controls. A larger study population with follow-up is required to determine whether fALFF holds promise as a potential biomarker for identifying subjects at increased risk to develop epilepsy.},

   abstract = {Mutations of the mitochondrial DNA are an important cause of inherited diseases that can severely affect the tissue's homeostasis and integrity. The m.3243A > G mutation is the most commonly observed across mitochondrial disorders and is linked to multisystemic complications, including cognitive deficits. In line with in vitro experiments demonstrating the m.3243A > G's negative impact on neuronal energy production and integrity, m.3243A > G patients show cerebral grey matter tissue changes. However, its impact on the most neuron dense, and therefore energy-consuming brain structure-the cerebellum-remains elusive. In this work, we used high-resolution structural and functional data acquired using 7 T MRI to characterize the neurodegenerative and functional signatures of the cerebellar cortex in m.3243A > G patients. Our results reveal altered tissue integrity within distinct clusters across the cerebellar cortex, apparent by their significantly reduced volume and longitudinal relaxation rate compared with healthy controls, indicating macroscopic atrophy and microstructural pathology. Spatial characterization reveals that these changes occur especially in regions related to the frontoparietal brain network that is involved in information processing and selective attention. In addition, based on resting-state functional MRI data, these clusters exhibit reduced functional connectivity to frontal and parietal cortical regions, especially in patients characterized by (i) a severe disease phenotype and (ii) reduced information-processing speed and attention control. Combined with our previous work, these results provide insight into the neuropathological changes and a solid base to guide longitudinal studies aimed to track disease progression.},

   abstract = {One of the most common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, the A to G transition at base pair 3243, has been linked to changes in the brain, in addition to commonly observed hearing problems, diabetes and myopathy. However, a detailed quantitative description of m.3243A>G patients' brains has not been provided so far. In this study, ultra-high field MRI at 7T and volume- and surface-based data analyses approaches were used to highlight morphology (i.e. atrophy)-, microstructure (i.e. myelin and iron concentration)- and metabolism (i.e. cerebral blood flow)-related differences between patients (N=22) and healthy controls (N=15). The use of quantitative MRI at 7T allowed us to detect subtle changes of biophysical processes in the brain with high accuracy and sensitivity, in addition to typically assessed lesions and atrophy. Furthermore, the effect of m.3243A>G mutation load in blood and urine epithelial cells on these MRI measures was assessed within the patient population and revealed that blood levels were most indicative of the brain's state and disease severity, based on MRI as well as on neuropsychological data. Morphometry MRI data showed a wide-spread reduction of cortical, subcortical and cerebellar gray matter volume, in addition to significantly enlarged ventricles. Moreover, surface-based analyses revealed brain area-specific changes in cortical thickness (e.g. of the auditory cortex), and in T1, T2* and cerebral blood flow as a function of mutation load, which can be linked to typically m.3243A>G-related clinical symptoms (e.g. hearing impairment). In addition, several regions linked to attentional control (e.g. middle frontal gyrus), the sensorimotor network (e.g. banks of central sulcus) and the default mode network (e.g. precuneus) were characterized by alterations in cortical thickness, T1, T2* and/or cerebral blood flow, which has not been described in previous MRI studies. Finally, several hypotheses, based either on vascular, metabolic or astroglial implications of the m.3243A>G mutation, are discussed that potentially explain the underlying pathobiology. To conclude, this is the first 7T and also the largest MRI study on this patient population that provides macroscopic brain correlates of the m.3243A>G mutation indicating potential MRI biomarkers of mitochondrial diseases and might guide future (longitudinal) studies to extensively track neuropathological and clinical changes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Observational research has shown that a substantial proportion of all dementia cases worldwide is attributable to modifiable risk factors. Dementia risk scores might be useful to identify high-risk individuals and monitor treatment adherence. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a dementia risk score, the LIfestyle for BRAin health (LIBRA) index, is associated with MRI markers and cognitive functioning/impairment in the general population. METHODS: Cross-sectional data was used from the observational population-based cohort of The Maastricht Study.. The weighted compound score of LIBRA (including twelve dementia risk and protective factors, e.g. hypertension, physical inactivity) was calculated, with higher scores indicating higher dementia risk. Standardized volumes of white matter, grey matter, CSF (as proxy for general brain atrophy), white matter hyperintensities, and presence of cerebral small vessel disease were derived from 3T MRI. Cognitive functioning was tested in three domains: memory, information processing speed, and executive function and attention. Values </=1.5 SD below the average were defined as cognitive impairment. Multiple regression analyses and structural equation modelling were used, adjusted for age, sex, education, intracranial volume and type-2 diabetes. RESULTS: Participants (n=4,164; mean age 59y; 49.7% men) with higher LIBRA scores (mean=1.19, range=-2.7 to +9.2), denoting higher dementia risk, had higher volumes of white matter hyperintensities (beta=0.051, p=.002), and lower scores on information processing speed (beta=-0.067, p=.001) and executive function and attention (beta=-0.065, p=.004). Only in men, associations between LIBRA and volumes of grey matter (beta=-0.093, p<.001), CSF (beta=0.104, p<.001) and memory (beta=-0.054, p=.026) were found. White matter hyperintensities and CSF volume partly mediated the association between LIBRA and cognition. DISCUSSION: Higher health- and lifestyle-based dementia risk is associated with markers of general brain atrophy, cerebrovascular pathology and worse cognition, suggesting that LIBRA meaningfully summarizes individual lifestyle-related brain health. Improving LIBRA factors on an individual level might improve population brain health. Sex differences in lifestyle-related pathology and cognition need to be further explored. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that higher LIBRA scores are significantly associated with lower scores on some cognitive domains and a higher risk of cognitive impairment.},

   abstract = {A variety of strategies are used to combine multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, yet recent literature lacks a systematic comparison of the available options. Here we compare six different approaches derived from multi-echo data and evaluate their influences on BOLD sensitivity for offline and in particular real-time use cases: a single-echo time series (based on Echo 2), the real-time T2*-mapped time series (T2*FIT) and four combined time series (T2*-weighted, tSNR-weighted, TE-weighted, and a new combination scheme termed T2*FIT-weighted). We compare the influences of these six multi-echo derived time series on BOLD sensitivity using a healthy participant dataset (N=28) with four task-based fMRI runs and two resting state runs. We show that the T2*FIT-weighted combination yields the largest increase in temporal signal-to-noise ratio across task and resting state runs. We demonstrate additionally for all tasks that the T2*FIT time series consistently yields the largest offline effect size measures and real-time region-of-interest based functional contrasts and temporal contrast-to-noise ratios. These improvements show the promising utility of multi-echo fMRI for studies employing real-time paradigms, while further work is advised to mitigate the decreased tSNR of the T2*FIT time series. We recommend the use and continued exploration of T2*FIT for offline task-based and real-time region-based fMRI analysis.

   abstract = {Neurofeedback training using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI-NF) allows subjects voluntary control of localised and distributed brain activity. It has sparked increased interest as a promising non-invasive treatment option in neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive disorders, although its efficacy and clinical significance are yet to be determined. In this work, we present the first extensive review of acquisition, processing and quality control methods available to improve the quality of the neurofeedback signal. Furthermore, we investigate the state of denoising and quality control practices in 128 recently published rtfMRI-NF studies. We found: (a) that less than a third of the studies reported implementing standard real-time fMRI denoising steps, (b) significant room for improvement with regards to methods reporting and (c) the need for methodological studies quantifying and comparing the contribution of denoising steps to the neurofeedback signal quality. Advances in rtfMRI-NF research depend on reproducibility of methods and results. Notably, a systematic effort is needed to build up evidence that disentangles the various mechanisms influencing neurofeedback effects. To this end, we recommend that future rtfMRI-NF studies: (a) report implementation of a set of standard real-time fMRI denoising steps according to a proposed COBIDAS-style checklist (https://osf.io/kjwhf/), (b) ensure the quality of the neurofeedback signal by calculating and reporting community-informed quality metrics and applying offline control checks and (c) strive to adopt transparent principles in the form of methods and data sharing and support of open-source rtfMRI-NF software. Code and data for reproducibility, as well as an interactive environment to explore the study data, can be accessed at https://github.com/jsheunis/quality-and-denoising-in-rtfmri-nf.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Heating of gradient coils and passive shim components is a common cause of instability in the B0 field, especially when gradient intensive sequences are used. The aim of the study was to set a benchmark for typical drift encountered during MR spectroscopy (MRS) to assess the need for real-time field-frequency locking on MRI scanners by comparing field drift data from a large number of sites. METHOD: A standardized protocol was developed for 80 participating sites using 99 3T MR scanners from 3 major vendors. Phantom water signals were acquired before and after an EPI sequence. The protocol consisted of: minimal preparatory imaging; a short pre-fMRI PRESS; a ten-minute fMRI acquisition; and a long post-fMRI PRESS acquisition. Both pre- and post-fMRI PRESS were non-water suppressed. Real-time frequency stabilization/adjustment was switched off when appropriate. Sixty scanners repeated the protocol for a second dataset. In addition, a three-hour post-fMRI MRS acquisition was performed at one site to observe change of gradient temperature and drift rate. Spectral analysis was performed using MATLAB. Frequency drift in pre-fMRI PRESS data were compared with the first 5:20 minutes and the full 30:00 minutes of data after fMRI. Median (interquartile range) drifts were measured and showed in violin plot. Paired t-tests were performed to compare frequency drift pre- and post-fMRI. A simulated in vivo spectrum was generated using FID-A to visualize the effect of the observed frequency drifts. The simulated spectrum was convolved with the frequency trace for the most extreme cases. Impacts of frequency drifts on NAA and GABA were also simulated as a function of linear drift. Data from the repeated protocol were compared with the corresponding first dataset using Pearson's and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). RESULTS: Of the data collected from 99 scanners, 4 were excluded due to various reasons. Thus, data from 95 scanners were ultimately analyzed. For the first 5:20 min (64 transients), median (interquartile range) drift was 0.44 (1.29) Hz before fMRI and 0.83 (1.29) Hz after. This increased to 3.15 (4.02) Hz for the full 30 min (360 transients) run. Average drift rates were 0.29 Hz/min before fMRI and 0.43 Hz/min after. Paired t-tests indicated that drift increased after fMRI, as expected (p < 0.05). Simulated spectra convolved with the frequency drift showed that the intensity of the NAA singlet was reduced by up to 26%, 44 % and 18% for GE, Philips and Siemens scanners after fMRI, respectively. ICCs indicated good agreement between datasets acquired on separate days. The single site long acquisition showed drift rate was reduced to 0.03 Hz/min approximately three hours after fMRI. DISCUSSION: This study analyzed frequency drift data from 95 3T MRI scanners. Median levels of drift were relatively low (5-min average under 1 Hz), but the most extreme cases suffered from higher levels of drift. The extent of drift varied across scanners which both linear and nonlinear drifts were observed.},

   abstract = {Hydrogen 1 (1H) magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy enables noninvasive in vivo quantification of metabolite concentrations in the brain. Currently, metabolite concentrations are most often presented as ratios (eg, relative to creatine) rather than as absolute concentrations. Despite the success of this approach, it has recently been suggested that relative quantification may introduce substantial errors and can lead to misinterpretation of spectral data and to erroneous metabolite values. The present review discusses relevant methods to obtain absolute metabolite concentrations with a clinical MR system by using single-voxel spectroscopy or chemical shift imaging. Important methodological aspects in an absolute quantification strategy are addressed, including radiofrequency coil properties, calibration procedures, spectral fitting methods, cerebrospinal fluid content correction, macromolecule suppression, and spectral editing. Techniques to obtain absolute concentrations are now available and can be successfully applied in clinical practice. Although the present review is focused on 1H MR spectroscopy of the brain, a large part of the methodology described can be applied to other tissues as well.},

   abstract = {The aim of the present study is to correlate non-invasive, pretreatment biological imaging (dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI [DCE-MRI] and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy [(1)H-MRS]) findings with specific molecular marker data in neck nodal metastases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Pretreatment DCE-MRI and (1)H-MRS were performed on neck nodal metastases of 12 patients who underwent surgery. Surgical specimens were analyzed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays for: Ki-67 (reflecting cellular proliferation), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (the "endogenous marker" of tumor vessel growth), carbonic anhydrase (CAIX), hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha), and human papillomavirus (HPV). Additionally, necrosis was estimated based on H&E staining. The Spearman correlation was used to compare DCE-MRI, (1)H-MRS, and molecular marker data. A significant correlation was observed between DCE-MRI parameter std(k(ep)) and VEGF IHC expression level (rho=0.81, p=0.0001). Furthermore, IHC expression levels of Ki-67 inversely correlated with std(K(trans)) and std(v(e)) (rho=-0.71; p=0.004, and rho=-0.73; p=0.003, respectively). Other DCE-MRI, (1)H-MRS and IHC values did not show significant correlation. The results of this preliminary study indicate that the level of heterogeneity of perfusion in metastatic HNSCC seems positively correlated with angiogenesis, and inversely correlated with proliferation. These results are preliminary in nature and are indicative, and not definitive, trends portrayed in HNSCC patients with nodal disease. Future studies with larger patient populations need to be carried out to validate and clarify our preliminary findings.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeated measurements in 10 healthy volunteers were used to establish the reproducibility of quantitative measures derived from different quantitative MR techniques, namely the T2 relaxation time, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the fractional anisotropy (FA), and metabolite concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), choline (Cho), and myo-inositol (mI). Results were compared with previously reported reproducibility measures from 1.5 T. RESULTS: The coefficient of variation (CV) was < or =1.6% for T2, < or =1.6% for ADC, and < or =5.3%, for FA in the cerebrum. For metabolites the CV was < or =8.0% in the frontal lobe and < or =20.4% in the temporal lobe. CONCLUSIONS: The reproducibility of quantitative brain MRI at 3.0 T is better than or at least comparable to the reproducibility at 1.5 T.},

Quantitative multimodal MRI was applied 24 h and 8 weeks later, in rats with FS and age-matched controls, and comprised hippocampal volumetry and proton spectroscopy, and cerebral T2 relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). At 9 weeks histology was performed. Hippocampal T2 relaxation time elevations appeared to be transient. DTI abnormalities detected in the amygdala persisted up to 8 weeks. Hippocampal volumes were not affected. Histology showed increased fiber density and anisotropy in the hippocampus, and reduced neuronal surface area in the amygdala. Quantitative serial MRI is able to detect transient, and most importantly, long-term FS-induced changes that reflect microstructural alterations.},

   abstract = {AIM: To investigate the merits of texture analysis on parametric maps derived from pharmacokinetic modeling with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) as imaging biomarkers for the prediction of treatment response in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: In this retrospective study, 19 HNSCC patients underwent pre- and intra-treatment DCE-MRI scans at a 1.5T MRI scanner. All patients had chemo-radiation treatment. Pharmacokinetic modeling was performed on the acquired DCE-MRI images, generating maps of volume transfer rate (K(trans)) and volume fraction of the extravascular extracellular space (ve). Image texture analysis was then employed on maps of K(trans) and ve, generating two texture measures: Energy (E) and homogeneity. RESULTS: No significant changes were found for the mean and standard deviation for K(trans) and ve between pre- and intra-treatment (P > 0.09). Texture analysis revealed that the imaging biomarker E of ve was significantly higher in intra-treatment scans, relative to pretreatment scans (P < 0.04). CONCLUSION: Chemo-radiation treatment in HNSCC significantly reduces the heterogeneity of tumors.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To correlate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and (18)F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([(18)F]FDG PET) of nodal metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for assessment of tumor biology. Additionally, pretreatment multimodality imaging was evaluated for its efficacy in predicting short-term response to treatment. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Metastatic neck nodes were imaged with (1)H-MRS, DCE-MRI, and [(18)F]FDG PET in 16 patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC, before treatment. Short-term patient radiological response was evaluated at 3 to 4 months. Correlations among (1)H-MRS (choline concentration relative to water [Cho/W]), DCE-MRI (volume transfer constant [K(trans)]; volume fraction of the extravascular extracellular space [v(e)]; and redistribution rate constant [k(ep)]), and [(18)F]FDG PET (standard uptake value [SUV] and total lesion glycolysis [TLG]) were calculated using nonparametric Spearman rank correlation. To predict short-term responses, logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was found between Cho/W and TLG (rho = 0.599; p = 0.031). Cho/W correlated negatively with heterogeneity measures of standard deviation std(v(e)) (rho = -0.691; p = 0.004) and std(k(ep)) (rho = -0.704; p = 0.003). Maximum SUV (SUVmax) values correlated strongly with MRI tumor volume (rho = 0.643; p = 0.007). Logistic regression indicated that std(K(trans)) and SUVmean were significant predictors of short-term response (p < 0.07). CONCLUSION: Pretreatment multimodality imaging using (1)H-MRS, DCE-MRI, and [(18)F]FDG PET is feasible in HNSCC patients with nodal metastases. Additionally, combined DCE-MRI and [(18)F]FDG PET parameters were predictive of short-term response to treatment.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess noninvasively the tumor microenvironment of neck nodal metastases in patients with head-and-neck cancer by investigating the relationship between tumor perfusion measured using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and hypoxia measured by (18)F-fluoromisonidazole ((18)F-FMISO) positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen newly diagnosed head-and-neck cancer patients with metastatic neck nodes underwent DCE-MRI and (18)F-FMISO PET imaging before chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The matched regions of interests from both modalities were analyzed. To examine the correlations between DCE-MRI parameters and standard uptake value (SUV) measurements from (18)F-FMISO PET, the nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated. Furthermore, DCE-MRI parameters were compared between nodes with (18)F-FMISO uptake and nodes with no (18)F-FMISO uptake using Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: For the 13 patients, a total of 18 nodes were analyzed. The nodal size strongly correlated with the (18)F-FMISO SUV (rho = 0.74, p < 0.001). There was a strong negative correlation between the median k(ep) (redistribution rate constant) value (rho = -0.58, p = 0.042) and the (18)F-FMISO SUV. Hypoxic nodes (moderate to severe (18)F-FMISO uptake) had significantly lower median K(trans) (volume transfer constant) (p = 0.049) and median k(ep) (p = 0.027) values than did nonhypoxic nodes (no (18)F-FMISO uptake). CONCLUSION: This initial evaluation of the preliminary results support the hypothesis that in metastatic neck lymph nodes, hypoxic nodes are poorly perfused (i.e., have significantly lower K(trans) and k(ep) values) compared with nonhypoxic nodes.},

   abstract = {The classification of embryonic and adult stem cells, including their derivatives, is still limited, and often these cells are best defined by their functional properties. Recent gene array studies have yielded contradictory results. Also, very little is known about the metabolic properties of these exciting cells. In this study, proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy was used to identify the major low-molecular-weight metabolites in murine embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their neural stem cell (NSC) derivatives. ESC are characterized by an unusually low number of NMR-detectable metabolites, high phosphocholine (PC) content, and nondetectable glycerophosphocholine (GPC). The metabolic profiles of NSC resemble glial cells and oligodendrocyte progenitors, but with considerably higher PC, GPC, and myo-inositol content. The results suggest that NMR spectroscopy in vitro can provide markers to study the effects of differentiation on cell metabolism, and potentially to assess stem cell preparations for differentiation status.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Water in biological structures often displays non-Gaussian diffusion behavior. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of non-Gaussian fitting by using the kurtosis model of the signal intensity decay curves obtained from DWI by using an extended range of b-values in studies of phantoms and HNSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with HNSCC underwent DWI by using 6 b-factors (0, 50-1500 s/mm(2)) at 1.5T. Monoexponential (yielding ADC(mono)) and non-Gaussian kurtosis (yielding apparent diffusion coefficient D(app) and apparent kurtosis coefficient K(app)) fits were performed on a voxel-by-voxel basis in selected regions of interest (primary tumors, metastatic lymph nodes, and spinal cord). DWI studies were also performed on phantoms containing either water or homogenized asparagus. To determine whether the kurtosis model provided a significantly better fit than did the monoexponential model, an F test was performed. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess correlations between K(app) and D(app). RESULTS: The kurtosis model fit the experimental data points significantly better than did the monoexponential model (P < .05). D(app) was approximately twice the value of ADC(mono) (eg, in neck nodal metastases D(app) was 1.54 and ADC(mono) was 0.84). K(app) showed a weak Spearman correlation with D(app) in a homogenized asparagus phantom and for 44% of tumor lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The use of kurtosis modeling to fit DWI data acquired by using an extended b-value range in HNSCC is feasible and yields a significantly better fit of the data than does monoexponential modeling. It also provides an additional parameter, K(app), potentially with added value.},

   abstract = {We investigated whether type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and the presence of cognitive impairment are associated with altered cerebral blood flow (CBF). Forty-one participants with and thirty-nine without T2DM underwent 3-Tesla MRI, including a quantitative technique measuring (macrovascular) blood flow in the internal carotid artery and an arterial spin labeling technique measuring (microvascular) perfusion in the grey matter (GM). Three analysis methods were used to quantify the CBF: a region of interest analysis, a voxel-based statistical parametric mapping technique, and a 'distributed deviating voxels' method. Participants with T2DM exhibited significantly more tissue with low CBF values in the cerebral cortex and the subcortical GM (3.8-fold increase). The latter was the only region where the hypoperfusion remained after correcting for atrophy, indicating that the effect of T2DM on CBF, independent of atrophy, is small. Subcortical CBF was associated with depression. No associations were observed for CBF in other regions with diabetes status, for carotid blood flow with diabetes status, or for CBF or flow in relation with cognitive function. To conclude, a novel method that tallies total 'distributed deviating voxels' demonstrates T2DM-associated hypoperfusion in the subcortical GM, not associated with cognitive performance. Whether a vascular mechanism underlies cognitive decrements remains inconclusive.},

   abstract = {For patients with chronic cryptogenic localisation-related epilepsy (CLRE), conventional MRI does not provide measures to discern between patients with or without cognitive complaints. We investigated, in a preliminary study, whether it is possible to detect cerebral biomarkers of cognitive impairment in patients with CLRE using sensitive quantitative MRI techniques. Neuropsychological assessment and quantitative 3.0 T MRI, comprising T2 relaxometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and spectroscopic imaging, were applied to 35 patients with CLRE and 21 healthy controls. Analysis included the left and right hippocampi, and frontal and temporal lobes. Differences between the groups and correlations with cognitive and clinical characteristics were assessed. Patients with epilepsy scored significantly worse on cognitive tasks compared to healthy controls. Significantly larger CSF fractions in the hippocampi and left temporal lobe, a longer T2 relaxation time in the left hippocampus, and a significantly higher concentration of glutamate/glutamine in the left frontal lobe were observed in patients with epilepsy. Moreover, poor memory performance was significantly correlated with larger CSF fractions in the right hippocampus and left temporal lobe in patients. In the temporal lobe, an association between subtle changes in morphology (indicative of atrophy) and memory performance was found, consistent with previous literature. These results may help to explain the alterations in brain functioning in patients with epilepsy.},

   abstract = {Objectives - The use of telencephalin as a possible marker for altered cortical function as demonstrated by functional MRI was investigated in a pilot study with 16 patients with localization-related epilepsy and secondarily generalized seizures. Materials and methods - Functional MRI of verbal working memory performance (Sternberg paradigm) and self-regulatory control processes (Stroop paradigm) was used to examine cortical activation in 16 patients with localization-related epilepsy and secondarily generalized seizures. Additionally, blood serum concentrations of soluble telencephalin (marker for neuronal damage) were determined. Results - In three patients (one temporal and two frontal focus), telencephalin was detected. All three patients had lower functional MRI activation in the frontotemporal region (P = 0.04), but not in other regions (P > 0.35) compared with patients without detectable telencephalin. Additionally, an association of levetiracetam and frontotemporal activation was observed. Conclusions - These preliminary data in a heterogeneous group suggest an association between decreased frontotemporal activation on fMRI and both detectable telencephalin serum levels and levetiracetam use. Future longitudinal studies with larger patient groups are required to confirm these observations. It is hypothesized that altered local function of the frontotemporal cortex in localization-related epilepsy might be better predicted by the biochemical marker telencephalin than epilepsy characteristics such as seizure focus.},

As (1) the decline of cognitive function is the most frequent comorbid disorder in epilepsy, and (2) patients with epilepsy have a relatively high prevalence of WML, the question is raised whether WML in patients with epilepsy are also associated with cognitive decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed at 3.0 T, comprising T1-weighted, T2 relaxometry, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Patients with localization-related epilepsy with impaired and unimpaired cognitive functioning and a healthy control group were included. Furthermore, the performance of an automated WML detection algorithm, based on regional intensity evaluation, was assessed. RESULTS: The prevalence of WML, detected on 3.0 T FLAIR images, is 63% in healthy volunteers and 46% in patients with localization-related, cryptogenic epilepsy. No relationship between WML volume and cognitive performance was observed. The WML volumes from the automated segmentation method were found to be significantly correlated to the volumes obtained by neuroradiologic assessment. CONCLUSIONS: No relations could be found between WML and cognition in the well-defined population of patients with epilepsy. Other clinical characteristics of chronic epilepsy, such as seizures, age of onset, and medication are more likely to play an important role in cognitive decline. Furthermore, the automated WML detection algorithm using a regional Z-score analysis can successfully segment and quantify the WML on FLAIR images.},

   abstract = {Patients with chronic epilepsy, who have suffered a high number of secondarily generalized tonicclonic seizures (SGTCS) frequently show cognitive comorbidity. It is yet unclear whether a higher
number of SGTCS is associated with tissue changes in the brain. We have investigated in patients with chronic epilepsy whether a high number of SGTCS accumulated over life is associated with
microstructural changes in brain tissue. Sixteen patients with localization-related epilepsy with SGTCS underwent a multimodal quantitative Magnetic Resonance (MR) examination at 1.5 T,
comprising T2 relaxometry, and diffusion weighted imaging to study microstructural changes in the temporal and frontal lobes. Fourteen healthy volunteers were also included to assess the
effect of age. Patients with more than 20 SGTCS (n=8) showed a significantly lower IQ (-20%, p<0.05) compared to those with less than 20 SGTCS (n=8). Furthermore, regional combined
multimodal analysis revealed that significant quantitative MRI changes, related to the number of SGTCS, were present in the frontal lobe but not in the temporal lobe. Moreover, the left and right
frontal lobe generally displayed lower T2 relaxation times, smaller pericortical cerebrospinal fluid fraction and lower apparent diffusion coefficients, in the patients with more than 20 SGTCS.
These findings suggest that SGTCS are associated with substantial changes in microstructural brain tissue characteristics within the frontal lobes. These frontal changes possibly explain the
cognitive problems which are often observed in patients with many SGTCS. This knowledge may help in the development of treatment aimed at preventing decline in cognitive abilities.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although volumetry of the hippocampus is considered to be an established technique, protocols reported in literature are not described in great detail. This article provides a complete and detailed protocol for hippocampal volumetry applicable to T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired at 3 Tesla, which has become the standard for structural brain research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The protocol encompasses T1-weighted image acquisition at 3 Tesla, anatomic guidelines for manual hippocampus delineation, requirements of delineation software, reliability measures, and criteria to assess and ensure sufficient reliability. Moreover, the validity of the correction for total intracranial volume size was critically assessed. The protocol was applied by 2 readers to the MR images of 36 patients with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy, 4 patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis, and 20 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: The uncorrected hippocampal volumes were 2923 +/- 500 mm3 (mean +/- SD) (left) and 3120 +/- 416 mm3 (right) for the patient group and 3185 +/- 411 mm3 (left) and 3302 +/- 411 mm3 (right) for the healthy control group. The volume of the 4 pathologic hippocampi of the patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis was 2980 +/- 422 mm3. The inter-reader reliability values were determined: intraclass-correlation-coefficient (ICC) = 0.87 (left) and 0.86 (right), percentage volume difference (VD) = 7.0 +/- 4.7% (left) and 6.0 +/- 3.8% (right), and overlap ratio (OR) = 0.82 +/- 0.04 (left) and 0.82 +/- 0.03 (right). The positive Pearson correlation between hippocampal volume and total intracranial volume was found to be low: r = 0.48 (P = 0.03, left) and r = 0.62 (P = 0.004, right) and did not significantly reduce the volumetric variances, showing the limited benefit of the brain size correction. CONCLUSIONS: A protocol was described to determine hippocampal volumes based on 3 Tesla MR images with high inter-reader reliability. Although the reliability of hippocampal volumetry at 3 Tesla was similar to the literature values obtained at 1.5 Tesla, hippocampal border definition is argued to be more confident and easier because of the improved signal-to-noise characteristics.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 2-year change in parenchymal diffusivity, a quantitative marker of microstructural tissue condition, and the relationship with baseline blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, in tissue at risk, i.e., the perilesional zone surrounding white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). METHODS: Patients with sporadic cSVD (lacunar stroke or mild vascular cognitive impairment) underwent 3T MRI at baseline, including dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify BBB permeability (i.e., leakage volume and rate) and intravoxel incoherent motion imaging (IVIM), a diffusion technique that provides parenchymal diffusivity D. After 2 years, IVIM was repeated. We assessed the relation between BBB leakage measures at baseline and change in parenchymal diffusivity (D) over 2 years in the perilesional zones (divided in 2-mm contours) surrounding WMH. RESULTS: We analyzed 43 patients (age 68 +/- 12 years, 58% male). In the perilesional zones, D increased 0.10% (confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.013%) (p < 0.01) per 2 mm closer to the WMH. Furthermore, D over 2 years showed a positive correlation with both baseline BBB leakage volume (r = 0.29 [CI 0.06-0.52], p = 0.013) and leakage rate (r = 0.24 [CI 0.02-0.47], p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: BBB leakage at baseline is related to the 2-year change in parenchymal diffusivity in the perilesional zone of WMH. These results support the hypothesis that BBB impairment might play an early role in subsequent microstructural white matter degeneration as part of the pathophysiology of cSVD.},

   abstract = {Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is one of the pathophysiological mechanisms in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Previously, it was shown that BBB leakage volume is larger in patients with SVD compared with controls. In this study, we investigated the link between BBB leakage and cognitive decline over 2 years in patients with cSVD. At baseline, 51 patients with clinically overt cSVD (lacunar stroke or mild vascular cognitive impairment) received a dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan to quantify BBB permeability in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cortical grey matter (CGM), and deep grey matter (DGM). Cognitive function in the domain executive function, information processing speed, and memory was measured in all patients at baseline and after 2 years. The association between baseline BBB leakage and cognitive decline over 2 years was determined with multivariable linear regression analysis, corrected for age, sex, educational level, baseline WMH volume, and baseline brain volume. Regression analyses showed that higher baseline leakage volume and rate in the NAWM and CGM were significantly associated with increased overall cognitive decline. Furthermore, higher baseline leakage volume in the NAWM and CGM, and higher baseline leakage rate in the CGM were significantly associated with increased decline in executive function. This longitudinal study showed that higher BBB leakage at baseline is associated with stronger cognitive decline, specifically in executive function, over 2 years of follow-up in patients with cSVD. These results emphasize the key role of BBB disruption in the pathophysiology and clinical progression of cSVD.},

Additionally, to incorporate objective (neuro-cognitive) and subjective (patient-reported) variables in identifying factors related to post-COVID-19 fatigue and cognitive complaints. DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Six Dutch hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 205 initially hospitalized (March-June 2020), confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2, aged >/=18 years, physically able to visit the hospital, without prior cognitive deficit, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contraindication, or severe neurologic damage post-hospital discharge (N=205). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nine months post-hospital discharge, a 3T MRI scan and cognitive testing were performed and patients completed questionnaires. Medical data were retrieved from medical dossiers. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed on fatigue severity (Fatigue Severity Scale; FSS) and cognitive complaints (Cognitive Consequences after Intensive Care Admission; CLC-IC; dichotomized into CLC-high/low). Variable blocks: (1) Demographic and premorbid factors (sex, age, education, comorbidities), (2) Illness severity (ICU/general ward, PROMIS physical functioning [PROMIS-PF]), (3) Neuro-cognitive factors (self-reported neurological symptoms, MRI abnormalities, cognitive performance), (4) Psychological and social factors (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], Utrecht Coping List, Social Support List), and (5) Fatigue or cognitive complaints. RESULTS: The final models explained 60% (FSS) and 48% (CLC-IC) variance, with most blocks (except neuro-cognitive factors for FSS) significantly contributing. Psychological and social factors accounted for 5% (FSS) and 11% (CLC-IC) unique variance. Higher FSS scores were associated with younger age (P=.01), lower PROMIS-PF (P<.001), higher HADS-Depression (P=.03), and CLC-high (P=.04). Greater odds of CLC-high were observed in individuals perceiving more social support (OR=1.07, P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results show that psychological and social factors add to biomedical factors in explaining persistent post-COVID-19 fatigue and cognitive complaints. Objective neuro-cognitive factors were not associated with symptoms. Findings highlight the importance of multidomain treatment, including psychosocial care, which may not target biologically-rooted symptoms directly but may reduce associated distress.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: COVID-19 affects the brain, leading to long-term complaints. Studies combining brain abnormalities with objective and subjective consequences are lacking. We investigated long-term structural brain abnormalities, neurological-, and (neuro)psychological consequences in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or general ward. We aimed to create a multidisciplinary view on the impact of severe COVID-19 on functioning and to compare long-term consequences between ICU and general ward patients. METHODS: This multicentre prospective cohort study assessed brain abnormalities (3T MRI), cognitive dysfunction (neuropsychological test battery), neurological symptoms, cognitive complaints, emotional distress, and wellbeing (self-report questionnaires) in ICU and general ward (non-ICU) survivors. RESULTS: 101 ICU and 104 non-ICU patients participated 8-10 months post-hospital discharge. Significantly more ICU patients exhibited cerebral microbleeds (61% versus 32%,p<0.001) and had higher numbers of microbleeds (p<0.001). No group differences were found in cognitive dysfunction, neurological symptoms, cognitive complaints, emotional distress, or wellbeing. The number of microbleeds did not predict cognitive dysfunction. In the complete sample, cognitive screening suggested cognitive dysfunction in 41%, standard neuropsychological testing showed cognitive dysfunction in 12%. Sixty-two% reported >/=3 cognitive complaints. Clinically relevant scores of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress were found in 15%, 19%, and 12%, respectively. Twenty-eight% experienced insomnia and 51% severe fatigue. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 ICU survivors had a higher prevalence for microbleeds but not for cognitive dysfunction compared to general ward survivors. Self-reported symptoms exceeded cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive complaints, neurological symptoms, and severe fatigue were frequently reported in both groups, fitting the post-COVID-19 syndrome.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Owing to the novelty of COVID-19, there are still large knowledge gaps concerning its effect on the brain and the resulting impact on peoples' lives. This large-scale prospective follow-up study investigates COVID-19-associated brain damage, neuropsychological dysfunction and long-term impact on the well-being of patients and their close ones. It is hypothesised that structural brain damage and cognitive dysfunction primarily occur in severely ill patients, as compared with moderately ill patients. Cognitive complaints, emotional distress and impact on well-being are hypothesised to be less dependent on illness severity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: For this multicentre study, 200 patients with COVID-19 (100 intensive care unit (ICU) patients and 100 non-ICU patients) formerly hospitalised in one of the six recruiting hospitals during the first European infection wave (ie, March to June 2020) and their close ones will be recruited. At minimally 6 months posthospital discharge, patients will perform a set of neuropsychological tests and are subjected to a 3T MRI scan. Patients and close ones will fill out a set of questionnaires, also at minimally 6 months posthospital discharge and again another 6 months thereafter. Data related to COVID-19 hospitalisation will be extracted from the patients' medical records. MRI abnormalities will ultimately be related to neuropsychological test performance and questionnaire outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was granted by the medical research ethics committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre and Maastricht University (NL75102.068.20). The project is sponsored by The Brain Foundation Netherlands. Findings will be presented at national and international conferences, as well as published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

   abstract = {Graph analysis was used to study the effects of accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS) on the brain's network topology in medication-resistant depressed patients. Anatomical and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was recorded at baseline and after sham and verum stimulation. Depression severity was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Using various graph measures, the different effects of sham and verum aiTBS were calculated. It was also investigated whether changes in graph measures were correlated to clinical responses. Furthermore, by correlating baseline graph measures with the changes in HDRS in terms of percentage, the potential of graph measures as biomarker was studied. Although no differences were observed between the effects of verum and sham stimulation on whole-brain graph measures and changes in graph measures did not correlate with clinical response, the baseline values of clustering coefficient and global efficiency showed to be predictive of the clinical response to verum aiTBS. Nodal effects were found throughout the whole brain. The distribution of these effects could not be linked to the strength of the functional connectivity between the stimulation site and the node. This study showed that the effects of aiTBS on graph measures distribute beyond the actual stimulation site. However, additional research into the complex interactions between different areas in the brain is necessary to understand the effects of aiTBS in more detail.},

   abstract = {In the context of neuroimaging experiments, it is essential to account for the multiple comparisons problem when thresholding statistical mappings. Various methods are in use to deal with this issue, but they differ in their signal detection power for small- and large-scale effects. In this paper, we comprehensively describe a new method that is based on control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature of neuroimaging effects. This is achieved by using a sliding window technique, in which FDR-control is first applied at a regional level. Thus, a new statistical map that is related to the regionally achieved FDR is derived from the available voxelwise P-values. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholding based on this map is demonstrated to have better discriminatory power than conventional thresholding based on P-values. Secondly, it is shown that the resulting maps can be thresholded at a level that results in control of the global FDR. By means of statistical arguments and numerical simulations under widely varying conditions, our method is validated, characterized, and compared to some other common voxel-based methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional FDR-control). It is found that our method shows considerably higher sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control, while still controlling the achieved FDR at the same level or better. Finally, our method is applied to two diverse neuroimaging experiments to assess its practical merits, resulting in substantial improvements as compared to the other methods.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The non-gaussian (NG)-IVIM model was developed and tested on diffusion-weighted MRI data collected on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner from eight patients with head and neck cancer. Voxel-wise parameter quantification was performed by using a noise-rectified least-square fitting method. The NG-IVIM, IVIM, Kurtosis, and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) models were used for comparison. For each voxel, within the metastatic node, the optimal model was determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion. The voxel percentage preferred by each model was calculated and the optimal model map was generated. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision dependency of the new model. RESULTS: For the eight neck nodes, the range of voxel percentage preferred by the NG-IVIM model was 2.3-79.3%. The optimal modal maps showed heterogeneities within the tumors. The Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the accuracy and precision of the NG-IVIM model improved by increasing signal-to-noise ratio and b value. CONCLUSION: The NG-IVIM model characterizes perfusion and restricted diffusion simultaneously in neck nodal metastases.},

METHODS: Sixteen patients with head and neck cancer underwent IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging on a 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The significance of parametric difference between primary tumors and metastatic nodes were tested. Probabilities of progression-free survival and overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In comparison with metastatic nodes, the primary tumors had significantly higher vascular volume fraction (f) (P < 0.0009) and lower diffusion coefficient (D) (P < 0.0002). Patients with lower SD for D had prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment IVIM measures were feasible in investigating the physiologic differences between the 2 tumor tissues. After appropriate validation, these findings might be useful in optimizing treatment planning and improving patient care.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although ethosuximide is one of the oldest antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), little information is available about the cognitive side effects of ethosuximide. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the cognitive profile of ethosuximide. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we used an extensive neuropsychological test battery in patients with epilepsy aged 6-16 years who were treated with monotherapy ethosuximide. We evaluated the efficacy of the drug by seizure frequency (seizure free or not). RESULTS: We included 61 patients with a mean age of 9.4 years [standard deviation (SD) 2.7] who used on average 686 mg/day (SD 245) ESM as monotherapy. ESM was effective in the majority of the patients (70 % were seizure free for at least 6 months at moment of inclusion). The total study population showed impairments of intelligence, visuomotor, and attentional function including activation/alertness. Comparisons between the well-controlled patients and patients who were not in remission showed significantly lower intelligence values and lower performance on the visual-perceptual and attentional tasks for the group with ongoing seizures. Our results suggested that the higher order cognitive dysfunctions (such as intelligence and visual-perceptual functions) may be regarded as seizure or aetiology effects and that the impaired fluid cognitive functions, such as activation/alertness, sustained auditory attention and attentional control or switching, were due to ESM. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the attentional dysfunction resulting in psychomotor slowing and alertness deficits may be regarded as effects of ethosuximide. Although no untreated baseline assessment was available, these effects are comparable to those of other AEDs, and ethosuximide may therefore be considered an AED with only mild effects on cognition. As ethosuximide is a first-line therapy for absence seizures in childhood, and drug-induced cognitive impairment may interfere with development, learning, and academic achievement, these findings are of interest to clinicians who prescribe this drug, especially when informing parents.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lacosamide (LCM) is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) with potential benefit as adjunctive treatment in patients with partial-onset seizures. As yet, limited information on cognitive effects of LCM is available, especially in real-life settings. AIMS: In this open clinical prospective study, the cognitive effects of LCM were evaluated when used as adjunctive antiepileptic therapy in patients with refractory epilepsy. METHODS: We included 33 patients aged between 16 and 74 years (mean: 37 years). All patients had a localization-related epilepsy. Patients were assessed at baseline before starting LCM treatment and during follow-up when the optimal clinical dose was achieved. MATERIALS: Subjective complaints were evaluated using the SIDAED; effects on cognition were evaluated using the computerized visual searching task (CVST). RESULTS: The CVST showed significant faster information processing reaction times at the second evaluation (P = 0.013), which was not correlated with seizure control, type of epilepsy, age, gender, drug load, number of concomitant drugs, dose or duration of LCM treatment. On the SIDAED, patients complained more about their cognitive function at the second evaluation (P = 0.005). For the SIDAED, a positive correlation at follow-up was found between the total severity score and higher age (r = 0.375, P = 0.031), but not with epilepsy factors or treatment characteristics. DISCUSSION/CONLUSION: Screening of the cognitive effects of LCM showed that LCM does not have negative effects on information processing speed. As this is the most sensitive function for cognitive side effects of AEDs, LCM does not seem to induce the common negative cognitive effects. Remarkably, patients complained more, especially about their cognitive function, which is possible the 'doing better, feeling worse phenomenon'.},

   abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease is characterised by decreased cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier impairments which play a key role in the development of white matter lesions. We hypothesised that cerebral hypoperfusion causes local hypoxia, affecting oligodendrocyte precursor cell-endothelial cell signalling leading to blood-brain barrier dysfunction as an early mechanism for the development of white matter lesions. Bilateral carotid artery stenosis was used as a mouse model for cerebral hypoperfusion. Pimonidazole, a hypoxic cell marker, was injected prior to humane sacrifice at day 7. Myelin content, vascular density, blood-brain barrier leakages, and hypoxic cell density were quantified. Primary mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cells were exposed to hypoxia and RNA sequencing was performed. Vegfa gene expression and protein secretion was examined in an oligodendrocyte precursor cell line exposed to hypoxia. Additionally, human blood plasma VEGFA levels were measured and correlated to blood-brain barrier permeability in normal-appearing white matter and white matter lesions of cerebral small vessel disease patients and controls. Cerebral blood flow was reduced in the stenosis mice, with an increase in hypoxic cell number and blood-brain barrier leakages in the cortical areas but no changes in myelin content or vascular density. Vegfa upregulation was identified in hypoxic oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which was mediated via Hif1alpha and Epas1. In humans, VEGFA plasma levels were increased in patients versus controls. VEGFA plasma levels were associated with increased blood-brain barrier permeability in normal appearing white matter of patients. Cerebral hypoperfusion mediates hypoxia induced VEGFA expression in oligodendrocyte precursor cells through Hif1alpha/Epas1 signalling. VEGFA could in turn increase BBB permeability. In humans, increased VEGFA plasma levels in cerebral small vessel disease patients were associated with increased blood-brain barrier permeability in the normal appearing white matter. Our results support a role of VEGFA expression in cerebral hypoperfusion as seen in cerebral small vessel disease.},

   abstract = {There is growing interest in the therapeutic utility of psychedelic substances, like psilocybin, for disorders characterized by distortions of the self-experience, like depression. Accumulating preclinical evidence emphasizes the role of the glutamate system in the acute action of the drug on brain and behavior; however this has never been tested in humans. Following a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design, we utilized an ultra-high field multimodal brain imaging approach and demonstrated that psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) induced region-dependent alterations in glutamate, which predicted distortions in the subjective experience of one's self (ego dissolution). Whereas higher levels of medial prefrontal cortical glutamate were associated with negatively experienced ego dissolution, lower levels in hippocampal glutamate were associated with positively experienced ego dissolution. Such findings provide further insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the psychedelic, as well as the baseline, state. Importantly, they may also provide a neurochemical basis for therapeutic effects as witnessed in ongoing clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world. However, because of a changing legal landscape and rising interest in therapeutic utility, there is an increasing trend in (long-term) use and possibly cannabis impairment. Importantly, a growing body of evidence suggests that regular cannabis users develop tolerance to the impairing, as well as the rewarding, effects of the drug. However, the neuroadaptations that may underlie cannabis tolerance remain unclear. Therefore, this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study assessed the acute influence of cannabis on the brain and behavioral outcomes in two distinct cannabis user groups. Twelve occasional and 12 chronic cannabis users received acute doses of cannabis (300-mug/kg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and placebo and underwent ultrahigh field functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In occasional users, cannabis induced significant neurometabolic alterations in reward circuitry, namely, decrements in functional connectivity and increments in striatal glutamate concentrations, which were associated with increases in subjective high and decreases in performance on a sustained attention task. Such changes were absent in chronic users. The finding that cannabis altered circuitry and distorted behavior in occasional, but not chronic users, suggests reduced responsiveness of the reward circuitry to cannabis intoxication in chronic users. Taken together, the results suggest a pharmacodynamic mechanism for the development of tolerance to cannabis impairment, of which is important to understand in the context of the long-term therapeutic use of cannabis-based medications, as well as in the context of public health and safety of cannabis use when performing day-to-day operations.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess whether an artificial neural network (ANN) model is a useful tool for automatic detection of cancerous voxels in the prostate from (1)H-MRSI datasets and whether the addition of information about anatomical segmentation improves the detection of cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Institutional Review Board approved this HIPAA-compliant study and waived informed consent. Eighteen men with prostate cancer (median age, 55 years; range, 36-71 years) who underwent endorectal MRI/MRSI before radical prostatectomy were included in this study. These patients had at least one cancer area on whole-mount histopathological map and at least one matching MRSI voxel suspicious for cancer detected. Two ANN models for automatic classification of MRSI voxels in the prostate were implemented and compared: model 1, which used only spectra as input, and model 2, which used the spectra plus information from anatomical segmentation. The models were trained, tested and validated using spectra from voxels that the spectroscopist had designated as cancer and that were verified on histopathological maps. RESULTS: At ROC analysis, model 2 (AUC = 0.968) provided significantly better (P = 0.03) classification of cancerous voxels than did model 1 (AUC = 0.949). CONCLUSION: Automatic analysis of prostate MRSI to detect cancer using ANN model is feasible. Application of anatomical segmentation from MRI as an additional input to ANN improves the accuracy of detecting cancerous voxels from MRSI.},

   abstract = {Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the only biomedical imaging method that can noninvasively detect endogenous signals from the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the human brain. Its increasing popularity has been aided by improvements in scanner hardware and acquisition methodology, as well as by broader access to pulse sequences that can selectively detect GABA, in particular J-difference spectral editing sequences. Nevertheless, implementations of GABA-edited MRS remain diverse across research sites, making comparisons between studies challenging. This large-scale multi-vendor, multi-site study seeks to better understand the factors that impact measurement outcomes of GABA-edited MRS. An international consortium of 24 research sites was formed. Data from 272 healthy adults were acquired on scanners from the three major MRI vendors and analyzed using the Gannet processing pipeline. MRS data were acquired in the medial parietal lobe with standard GABA+ and macromolecule- (MM-) suppressed GABA editing. The coefficient of variation across the entire cohort was 12% for GABA+ measurements and 28% for MM-suppressed GABA measurements. A multilevel analysis revealed that most of the variance (72%) in the GABA+ data was accounted for by differences between participants within-site, while site-level differences accounted for comparatively more variance (20%) than vendor-level differences (8%). For MM-suppressed GABA data, the variance was distributed equally between site- (50%) and participant-level (50%) differences. The findings show that GABA+ measurements exhibit strong agreement when implemented with a standard protocol. There is, however, increased variability for MM-suppressed GABA measurements that is attributed in part to differences in site-to-site data acquisition. This study's protocol establishes a framework for future methodological standardization of GABA-edited MRS, while the results provide valuable benchmarks for the MRS community.},

   abstract = {Accurate and reliable quantification of brain metabolites measured in vivo using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a topic of continued interest. Aside from differences in the basic approach to quantification, the quantification of metabolite data acquired at different sites and on different platforms poses an additional methodological challenge. In this study, spectrally edited gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) MRS data were analyzed and GABA levels were quantified relative to an internal tissue water reference. Data from 284 volunteers scanned across 25 research sites were collected using GABA+ (GABA + co-edited macromolecules (MM)) and MM-suppressed GABA editing. The unsuppressed water signal from the volume of interest was acquired for concentration referencing. Whole-brain T1-weighted structural images were acquired and segmented to determine gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid voxel tissue fractions. Water-referenced GABA measurements were fully corrected for tissue-dependent signal relaxation and water visibility effects. The cohort-wide coefficient of variation was 17% for the GABA + data and 29% for the MM-suppressed GABA data. The mean within-site coefficient of variation was 10% for the GABA + data and 19% for the MM-suppressed GABA data. Vendor differences contributed 53% to the total variance in the GABA + data, while the remaining variance was attributed to site- (11%) and participant-level (36%) effects. For the MM-suppressed data, 54% of the variance was attributed to site differences, while the remaining 46% was attributed to participant differences. Results from an exploratory analysis suggested that the vendor differences were related to the unsuppressed water signal acquisition. Discounting the observed vendor-specific effects, water-referenced GABA measurements exhibit similar levels of variance to creatine-referenced GABA measurements. It is concluded that quantification using internal tissue water referencing is a viable and reliable method for the quantification of in vivo GABA levels.},

   abstract = {Quality control of brain segmentation is a fundamental step to ensure data quality. Manual quality control strategies are the current gold standard, although these may be unfeasible for large neuroimaging samples. Several options for automated quality control have been proposed, providing potential time efficient and reproducible alternatives. However, those have never been compared side to side, which prevents consensus in the appropriate QC strategy to use. This study aimed to elucidate the changes manual editing of brain segmentations produce in morphological estimates, and to analyze and compare the effects of different quality control strategies on the reduction of the measurement error. Structural MR images from 259 participants of The Maastricht Study were used. Morphological estimates were automatically extracted using FreeSurfer 6.0. Segmentations with inaccuracies were manually edited, and morphological estimates were compared before and after editing. In parallel, 12 quality control strategies were applied to the full sample. Those included: two manual strategies, in which images were visually inspected and either excluded or manually edited; five automated strategies, where outliers were excluded based on the tools "MRIQC" and "Qoala-T", and the metrics "morphological global measures", "Euler numbers" and "Contrast-to-Noise ratio"; and five semi-automated strategies, where the outliers detected through the mentioned tools and metrics were not excluded, but visually inspected and manually edited. In order to quantify the effects of each QC strategy, the proportion of unexplained variance relative to the total variance was extracted after the application of each QC strategy, and the resulting differences compared. Manually editing brain surfaces produced particularly large changes in subcortical brain volumes and moderate changes in cortical surface area, thickness and hippocampal volumes. The performance of the quality control strategies depended on the morphological measure of interest. Manual quality control strategies yielded the largest reduction in relative unexplained variance. The best performing automated alternatives were those based on Euler numbers and MRIQC scores. The exclusion of outliers based on global morphological measures produced an increase of relative unexplained variance. Manual quality control strategies are the most reliable solution for quality control of brain segmentation and parcellation. However, measures must be taken to prevent the subjectivity associated with these strategies. The detection of inaccurate segmentations based on Euler numbers and MRIQC provide a time efficient and reproducible alternative. The exclusion of outliers based on global morphological estimates must be avoided.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We investigated whether prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and continuous measures of hyperglycemia are associated with tissue volume differences in specific subfields of the hippocampus. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from 4,724 participants (58.7 +/- 8.5 years, 51.5% women) of The Maastricht Study, a population-based prospective cohort. Glucose metabolism status was assessed with an oral glucose tolerance test, and defined as type 2 diabetes (n = 869), prediabetes (n = 671), or normal glucose metabolism (n = 3184). We extracted 12 hippocampal subfield volumes per hemisphere with FreeSurfer v6.0 using T1w and FLAIR 3T MRI images. We used multiple linear regression and linear trend analysis, and adjusted for total intracranial volume, demographic, lifestyle, and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes was significantly associated with smaller volumes in the hippocampal subfield fimbria (standardized beta coefficient +/- standard error (beta +/- SE) = -0.195 +/- 0.04, p-value < 0.001), the hippocampus proper, i.e. Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/3, CA4, dentate gyrus, subiculum and presubiculum (beta +/- SE < -0.105 +/- 0.04, p-value < 0.006); as well as the hippocampal tail (beta +/- SE = -0.162 +/- 0.04, p-value < 0.001). Prediabetes showed no significant associations. However, linear trend analysis indicated a dose-response relation from normal glucose metabolism, to prediabetes, to type 2 diabetes. Multiple continuous measures of hyperglycemia were associated with smaller volumes of the subfields fimbria (beta +/- SE < -0.010 +/- 0.011, p-value < 0.001), dentate gyrus (beta +/- SE < -0.013 +/- 0.010, p-value < 0.002), CA3 (beta +/- SE < -0.014 +/- 0.011, p-value < 0.001), and tail (beta +/- SE < -0.006 +/- 0.012, p-value < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Type 2 diabetes and measures of hyperglycemia are associated with hippocampal subfield atrophy, independently of lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors. We found evidence for a dose-response relationship from normal glucose metabolism, to prediabetes, to type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes stages could give a window of opportunity for the early prevention of brain disease.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Late-life depression has been associated with volume changes of the hippocampus. However, little is known about its association with specific hippocampal subfields over time. AIMS: We investigated whether hippocampal subfield volumes were associated with prevalence, course and incidence of depressive symptoms. METHOD: We extracted 12 hippocampal subfield volumes per hemisphere with FreeSurfer v6.0 using T(1)-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery 3T magnetic resonance images. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and annually over 7 years of follow-up (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire). We used negative binominal, logistic, and Cox regression analyses, corrected for multiple comparisons, and adjusted for demographic, cardiovascular and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: A total of n = 4174 participants were included (mean age 60.0 years, s.d. = 8.6, 51.8% female). Larger right hippocampal fissure volume was associated with prevalent depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.48). Larger bilateral hippocampal fissure (OR = 1.37-1.40, 95% CI 1.14-1.71), larger right molecular layer (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.14-2.00) and smaller right cornu ammonis (CA)3 volumes (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.48-0.79) were associated with prevalent depressive symptoms with a chronic course. No associations of hippocampal subfield volumes with incident depressive symptoms were found. Yet, lower left hippocampal amygdala transition area (HATA) volume was associated with incident depressive symptoms with chronic course (hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in hippocampal fissure, molecular layer and CA volumes might co-occur or follow the onset of depressive symptoms, in particular with a chronic course. Smaller HATA was associated with an increased risk of incident (chronic) depression. Our results could capture a biological foundation for the development of chronic depressive symptoms, and stresses the need to discriminate subtypes of depression to unravel its biological underpinnings.},

   abstract = {Identifying a structural brain lesion on MRI has important implications in epilepsy and is the most important factor that correlates with seizure freedom after surgery in patients with drug-resistant focal onset epilepsy. However, at conventional magnetic field strengths (1.5 and 3T), only approximately 60%-85% of MRI examinations reveal such lesions. Over the last decade, studies have demonstrated the added value of 7T MRI in patients with and without known epileptogenic lesions from 1.5 and/or 3T. However, translation of 7T MRI to clinical practice is still challenging, particularly in centers new to 7T, and there is a need for practical recommendations on targeted use of 7T MRI in the clinical management of patients with epilepsy. The 7T Epilepsy Task Force-an international group representing 21 7T MRI centers with experience from scanning over 2,000 patients with epilepsy-would hereby like to share its experience with the neurology community regarding the appropriate clinical indications, patient selection and preparation, acquisition protocols and setup, technical challenges, and radiologic guidelines for 7T MRI in patients with epilepsy. This article mainly addresses structural imaging; in addition, it presents multiple nonstructural MRI techniques that benefit from 7T and hold promise as future directions in epilepsy. Answering to the increased availability of 7T MRI as an approved tool for diagnostic purposes, this article aims to provide guidance on clinical 7T MRI epilepsy management by giving recommendations on referral, suitable 7T MRI protocols, and image interpretation.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An association between impaired school performance and rolandic epilepsy is frequently reported. Language outcome, in particular, seems to be affected, although rolandic epilepsy originates from the motor-sensory cortex. In this study we tried to find a correlation between locomotion problems and language impairment. METHODS: In this noncontrolled, open, clinical cohort study of 48 children with rolandic epilepsy, a 24-hour EEG and a neuropsychological assessment were obtained for all children. RESULTS: Children with rolandic epilepsy had a significant delay in reading skills (reading words: mean=6 months, SD=11.9, P<0.002; reading sentences: mean=8.6 months, SD=12.7, P<0.001), compared with the healthy population. There was a significant correlation between problems in motor development and delays in reading skills (reading words: r=-0.426, P=0.006; reading sentences: r=-0.343, P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Reading performance is impaired in children with rolandic epilepsy. Reading of sentences is more impaired than reading of words. There is a significant correlation between problems in motor development and language, suggesting their interaction at the level of the cortex.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rolandic epilepsy, a childhood epilepsy associated with language impairments, was investigated for language-related cortical abnormalities. METHODS: Twenty-four children with rolandic epilepsy and 24 controls (age 8-14 years) were recruited and underwent the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals test. Structural MRI was performed at 3 T (voxel size 1 x 1 x 1 mm(3)) for fully automated quantitative assessment of cortical thickness. Regression analysis was used to test for differences between patients and controls and to assess the effect of age and language indices on cortical thickness. RESULTS: For patients the core language score (mean +/- SD: 92 +/- 18) was lower than for controls (106 +/- 11, p = 0.0026) and below the norm of 100 +/- 15 (p = 0.047). Patients showed specific impairments in receptive language index (87 +/- 19, p = 0.002) and language content index (87 +/- 18, p = 0.0016). Cortical thickness was reduced in patients (p < 0.05, multiple-comparisons corrected) in left perisylvian regions. Furthermore, extensive cortical thinning with age was found in predominantly left-lateralized frontal, centro-parietal and temporal regions. No associations were found between cortical thickness and language indices in the regions of aberrant cortex. CONCLUSION: The cortical abnormalities described represent subtle but significant pathomorphology in this critical phase of brain development (8-14 years) and suggest that rolandic epilepsy should not be considered merely a benign condition. Future studies employing longitudinal designs are prompted for further investigations into cerebral abnormalities in RE and associations with cognitive impairment and development.},

However, from the literature it is unclear exactly which domains are affected; A wide variety of investigations are reported that each provide a different representation of language performance in these patients. AIMS: The aim of this study is to compare performance on the language domains between children with Rolandic epilepsy and healthy controls. METHODS: Prospective study of children with Rolandic epilepsy compared to healthy controls. 25 children (mean age 136.6 months, SD 23.0) with Rolandic epilepsy and 25 age-matched healthy controls were tested on their language function using the CELF-4 (Clinical evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Dutch edition). The healthy control were not matched regard to other important factors, particularly educational attainment and co-morbidity. Expressive language, receptive language, language content, language structure and language working memory were tested. RESULTS: In children with Rolandic epilepsy, the core language score was significant lower compared with healthy controls. They scored specifically lower on the receptive language index and language content index (both p = 0.002). A trend towards decreased expressive language index was observed (p = 0.054). Language structure and language working memory were in the normal range. CONCLUSION: Language was found to be impaired in children with typical Rolandic epilepsy. Especially semantic language processing including receptive language and language content was significantly impaired. The common denominator of these functions is semantic language processing.},

   abstract = {Objective diagnosis and prognosis in major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a challenge due to the absence of biomarkers based on physiological parameters or medical tests. Numerous studies have been conducted to identify functional magnetic resonance imaging-based biomarkers of depression that either objectively differentiate patients with depression from healthy subjects, predict personalized treatment outcome, or characterize biological subtypes of depression. While there are some findings of consistent functional biomarkers, there is still lack of robust data acquisition and analysis methodology. According to current findings, primarily, the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and default mode network play a crucial role in MDD. Yet, there are also less consistent results and the involvement of other regions or networks remains ambiguous. We further discuss image acquisition, processing, and analysis limitations that might underlie these inconsistencies. Finally, the current review aims to address and discuss possible remedies and future opportunities that could improve the search for consistent functional imaging biomarkers of depression. Novel acquisition techniques, such as multiband and multiecho imaging, and neural network-based cleaning approaches can enhance the signal quality in limbic and frontal regions. More comprehensive analyses, such as directed or dynamic functional features or the identification of biological depression subtypes, can improve objective diagnosis or treatment outcome prediction and mitigate the heterogeneity of MDD. Overall, these improvements in functional MRI imaging techniques, processing, and analysis could advance the search for biomarkers and ultimately aid patients with MDD and their treatment course.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Approximately one in six people will experience an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) in their lifetime. Effective treatment is hindered by subjective clinical decision-making and a lack of objective prognostic biomarkers. Functional MRI (fMRI) could provide such an objective measure but the majority of MDD studies has focused on static approaches, disregarding the rapidly changing nature of the brain. In this study, we aim to predict depression severity changes at 3 and 6 months using dynamic fMRI features. METHODS: For our research, we acquired a longitudinal dataset of 32 MDD patients with fMRI scans acquired at baseline and clinical follow-ups 3 and 6 months later. Several measures were derived from an emotion face-matching fMRI dataset: activity in brain regions, static and dynamic functional connectivity between functional brain networks (FBNs) and two measures from a wavelet coherence analysis approach. All fMRI features were evaluated independently, with and without demographic and clinical parameters. Patients were divided into two classes based on changes in depression severity at both follow-ups. RESULTS: The number of coherence clusters (nCC) between FBNs, reflecting the total number of interactions (either synchronous, anti-synchronous or causal), resulted in the highest predictive performance. The nCC-based classifier achieved 87.5% and 77.4% accuracy for the 3- and 6-months change in severity, respectively. Furthermore, regression analyses supported the potential of nCC for predicting depression severity on a continuous scale. The posterior default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and two visual networks were the most important networks in the optimal nCC models. Reduced nCC was associated with a poorer depression course, suggesting deficits in sustained attention to and coping with emotion-related faces. An ensemble of classifiers with demographic, clinical and lead coherence features, a measure of dynamic causality, resulted in a 3-months clinical outcome prediction accuracy of 81.2%. DISCUSSION: The dynamic wavelet features demonstrated high accuracy in predicting individual depression severity change. Features describing brain dynamics could enhance understanding of depression and support clinical decision-making. Further studies are required to evaluate their robustness and replicability in larger cohorts.},

   abstract = {RESEARCH PURPOSE: The low treatment effectiveness in major depressive disorder (MDD) may be caused by the subjectiveness in clinical examination and the lack of quantitative tests. Objective biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may support clinical experts during decision-making. Numerous studies have attempted to identify such MRI-based biomarkers. However, the majority is uni-modal (based on a single MRI modality) and focus on either MDD diagnosis or outcome. Uncertainty remains regarding whether key features or classification models for diagnosis may also be used for outcome prediction. Therefore, we aim to find multi-modal predictors of both, MDD diagnosis and outcome. By addressing these research questions using the same dataset, we eliminate between-study confounding factors. Various structural (T(1)-weighted, T(2)-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)) and functional (resting-state and task-based functional MRI) scans were acquired from 32 MDD and 31 healthy control (HC) subjects during the first visit at the investigational site (baseline). Depression severity was assessed at baseline and 6 months later. Features were extracted from the baseline MRI images with different modalities. Binary 6-months negative and positive outcome (NO; PO) classes were defined based on relative (to baseline) change in depression severity. Support vector machine models were employed to separate MDD from HC (diagnosis) and NO from PO subjects (outcome). Classification was performed through a uni-modal (features from a single MRI modality) and multi-modal (combination of features from different modalities) approach. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Our results show that DTI features yielded the highest uni-modal performance for diagnosis and outcome prediction: mean diffusivity (AUC (area under the curve) = 0.701) and the sum of streamline weights (AUC = 0.860), respectively. Multi-modal ensemble classifiers with T(1)-weighted, resting-state functional MRI and DTI features improved classification performance for both diagnosis and outcome (AUC = 0.746 and 0.932, respectively). Feature analyses revealed that the most important features were located in frontal, limbic and parietal areas. However, the modality or location of these features was different between diagnostic and prognostic models. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that combining features from different MRI modalities predict MDD diagnosis and outcome with higher performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the most important features for MDD diagnosis were different and located in other brain regions than those for outcome. This longitudinal study contributes to the identification of objective biomarkers of MDD and its outcome. Follow-up studies may further evaluate the generalizability of our models in larger or multi-center cohorts.},

   abstract = {Background The hardware and software differences between MR vendors and individual sites influence the quantification of MR spectroscopy data. An analysis of a large data set may help to better understand sources of the total variance in quantified metabolite levels. Purpose To compare multisite quantitative brain MR spectroscopy data acquired in healthy participants at 26 sites by using the vendor-supplied single-voxel point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence. Materials and Methods An MR spectroscopy protocol to acquire short-echo-time PRESS data from the midparietal region of the brain was disseminated to 26 research sites operating 3.0-T MR scanners from three different vendors. In this prospective study, healthy participants were scanned between July 2016 and December 2017. Data were analyzed by using software with simulated basis sets customized for each vendor implementation. The proportion of total variance attributed to vendor-, site-, and participant-related effects was estimated by using a linear mixed-effects model. P values were derived through parametric bootstrapping of the linear mixed-effects models (denoted Pboot). Results In total, 296 participants (mean age, 26 years +/- 4.6; 155 women and 141 men) were scanned. Good-quality data were recorded from all sites, as evidenced by a consistent linewidth of N-acetylaspartate (range, 4.4-5.0 Hz), signal-to-noise ratio (range, 174-289), and low Cramer-Rao lower bounds (</=5%) for all of the major metabolites. Among the major metabolites, no vendor effects were found for levels of myo-inositol (Pboot > .90), N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (Pboot = .13), or glutamate and glutamine (Pboot = .11). Among the smaller resonances, no vendor effects were found for ascorbate (Pboot = .08), aspartate (Pboot > .90), glutathione (Pboot > .90), or lactate (Pboot = .28). Conclusion Multisite multivendor single-voxel MR spectroscopy studies performed at 3.0 T can yield results that are coherent across vendors, provided that vendor differences in pulse sequence implementation are accounted for in data analysis. However, the site-related effects on variability were more profound and suggest the need for further standardization of spectroscopic protocols.

   abstract = {N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is the second most abundant metabolite in the human brain; although it is assumed to be a proxy for a neuronal marker, its function is not fully elucidated. NAA is also detectable in plasma, but its relation to cerebral NAA levels, cognitive performance, or features of cerebral disease has not been investigated. To study whether circulating NAA tracks cerebral NAA levels, and whether circulating NAA correlates with cognitive function and features of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). Two datasets were analyzed. In dataset 1, structural MRI was acquired in 533 subjects to assess four features of cerebral SVD. Cognitive function was evaluated with standardized test scores (N = 824). In dataset 2, brain (1)H-MRS from the occipital region was acquired (N = 49). In all subjects, fasting circulating NAA was measured with mass spectrometry. Dataset 1: in univariate and adjusted for confounders models, we found no correlation between circulating NAA and the examined features of cerebral SVD. In univariate analysis, circulating NAA levels were associated inversely with the speed in information processing and the executive function score, however these associations were lost after accounting for confounders. In line with the negative findings of dataset 1, in dataset 2 there was no correlation between circulating and central NAA or total NAA levels. This study indicates that circulating NAA levels do not reflect central (occipital) NAA levels, cognitive function, or cerebral small vessel disease in man.},

   abstract = {The human brain undergoes metabolic adaptations in obesity, but the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unknown. We compared concentrations of often reported brain metabolites measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS, 3 T MRI) in the occipital lobe in subjects with obesity and lean controls under different metabolic conditions (fasting, insulin clamp, following weight loss). Brain glucose uptake (BGU) quantified with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET)) was also performed in a subset of subjects during clamp. In dataset A, 48 participants were studied during fasting with brain (1)H-MRS, while in dataset B 21 participants underwent paired brain (1)H-MRS acquisitions under fasting and clamp conditions. In dataset C 16 subjects underwent brain (18)F-FDG-PET and (1)H-MRS during clamp. In the fasting state, total N-acetylaspartate was lower in subjects with obesity, while brain myo-inositol increased in response to hyperinsulinemia similarly in both lean participants and subjects with obesity. During clamp, BGU correlated positively with brain glutamine/glutamate, total choline, and total creatine levels. Following weight loss, brain creatine levels were increased, whereas increases in other metabolites remained not significant. To conclude, insulin signaling and glucose metabolism are significantly coupled with several of the changes in brain metabolites that occur in obesity.},

   abstract = {The mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment are incompletely understood but may include arterial stiffness and microvascular dysfunction. In the population-based Maastricht Study, we investigated the association between arterial stiffness and cognitive performance, and whether any such association was mediated by microvascular dysfunction. We included cross-sectional data of 2544 participants (age, 59.7 years; 51.0% men; 26.0% type 2 diabetes mellitus). We used carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid distensibility coefficient as measures of aortic and carotid stiffness, respectively. We calculated a composite score of microvascular dysfunction based on magnetic resonance imaging features of cerebral small vessel disease, flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation response, albuminuria, and plasma biomarkers of microvascular dysfunction (sICAM-1 [soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1], sVCAM-1 [soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1], sE-selectin [soluble E-selectin], and vWF [von Willebrand factor]). Cognitive domains assessed were memory, processing speed, and executive function. A cognitive function score was calculated as the average of these domains. Higher aortic stiffness (per m/s) was associated with lower cognitive function (beta, -0.018 SD [95% CI, -0.036 to -0.000]) independent of age, sex, education, and cardiovascular risk factors, but higher carotid stiffness was not. Higher aortic stiffness (per m/s) was associated with a higher microvascular dysfunction score (beta, 0.034 SD [95% CI, 0.014 to 0.053]), and a higher microvascular dysfunction score (per SD) was associated with lower cognitive function (beta, -0.089 SD [95% CI, -0.124 to -0.053]). Microvascular dysfunction significantly explained 16.2% of the total effect of aortic stiffness on cognitive function. The present study showed that aortic stiffness, but not carotid stiffness, is independently associated with worse cognitive performance, and that this association is in part explained by microvascular dysfunction.},

   abstract = {Microvascular dysfunction may be associated with worse cognitive performance. Most previous studies did not adjust for important confounders, evaluated only individual measures of microvascular dysfunction, and showed inconsistent results. We evaluated the association between a comprehensive set of measures of microvascular dysfunction and cognitive performance in the population-based Maastricht Study. We used cross-sectional data including 3011 participants (age 59.5+/-8.2; 48.9% women; 26.5% type 2 diabetes mellitus [oversampled by design]). Measures of microvascular dysfunction included magnetic resonance imaging features of cerebral small vessel disease, plasma biomarkers of microvascular dysfunction, albuminuria, flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation response and heat-induced skin hyperemia. These measures were summarized into a microvascular dysfunction composite score. Cognitive domains assessed were memory, processing speed, and executive function. A cognitive function score was calculated as the sum of the scores on these 3 cognitive domains. The microvascular dysfunction score was associated with a worse cognitive function score (standardized beta, -0.087 [95% CI, -0.127 to -0.047]), independent of age, education level, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol use, hypertension, total/HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, lipid-modifying medication, prior cardiovascular disease, depression and plasma biomarkers of low-grade inflammation. The fully adjusted beta-coefficient of the association between the microvascular dysfunction score and the cognitive function score was equivalent to 2 (range, 1-3) years of aging for each SD higher microvascular dysfunction score. The microvascular dysfunction score was associated with worse memory and processing speed but not with worse executive function. The present study shows that microvascular dysfunction is associated with worse cognitive performance.},

   abstract = {Characterization of flow properties in cerebral arteries with 1.5 and 3 Tesla MRI is usually limited to large cerebral arteries and difficult to evaluate in the small perforating arteries due to insufficient spatial resolution. In this study, we assessed the feasibility to measure blood flow waveforms in the small lenticulostriate arteries with 7 Tesla velocity-sensitive MRI. The middle cerebral artery was included as reference. Imaging was performed in five young and five old healthy volunteers. Flow was calculated by integrating time-varying velocity values over the vascular cross-section. MRI acquisitions were performed twice in each subject to determine reproducibility. From the flow waveforms, the pulsatility index and damping factor were deduced. Reproducibility values, in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficients, were found to be good to excellent. Measured pulsatility index of the lenticulostriate arteries significantly increased and damping factor significantly decreased with age. In conclusion, we demonstrate that blood flow through the lenticostriate arteries can be precisely measured using 7 Tesla MRI and reveal effects of arterial stiffness due to aging. These findings hold promise to provide relevant insights into the pathologies involving perforating cerebral arteries.},

   abstract = {The Maastricht Study is an extensive phenotyping study that focuses on the etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), its classic complications, and its emerging comorbidities. The study uses state-of-the-art imaging techniques and extensive biobanking to determine health status in a population-based cohort of 10,000 individuals that is enriched with T2DM individuals. Enrollment started in November 2010 and is anticipated to last 5-7 years. The Maastricht Study is expected to become one of the most extensive phenotyping studies in both the general population and T2DM participants world-wide. The Maastricht study will specifically focus on possible mechanisms that may explain why T2DM accelerates the development and progression of classic complications, such as cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy and of emerging comorbidities, such as cognitive decline, depression, and gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and respiratory diseases. In addition, it will also examine the association of these variables with quality of life and use of health care resources. This paper describes the rationale, overall study design, recruitment strategy and methods of basic measurements, and gives an overview of all measurements that are performed within The Maastricht Study.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) can provide information regarding tumor perfusion and permeability and has shown prognostic value in certain tumors types. The goal of this study was to assess the prognostic value of pretreatment DCE-MRI in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients with nodal disease undergoing chemoradiation therapy or surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-four patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma and neck nodal metastases were eligible for the study. Pretreatment DCE-MRI was performed on a 1.5T MRI. Clinical follow-up was a minimum of 12 months. DCE-MRI data were analyzed using the Tofts model. DCE-MRI parameters were related to treatment outcome (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]). Patients were grouped as no evidence of disease (NED), alive with disease (AWD), dead with disease (DOD), or dead of other causes (DOC). Prognostic significance was assessed using the log-rank test for single variables and Cox proportional hazards regression for combinations of variables. RESULTS: At last clinical follow-up, for Stage III, all 12 patients were NED. For Stage IV, 43 patients were NED, 4 were AWD, 11 were DOD, and 4 were DOC. K(trans) is volume transfer constant. In a stepwise Cox regression, skewness of K(trans) (volume transfer constant) was the strongest predictor for Stage IV patients (PFS and OS: p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that skewness of K(trans) was the strongest predictor of PFS and OS in Stage IV HNSCC patients with nodal disease. This study suggests an important role for pretreatment DCE-MRI parameter K(trans) as a predictor of outcome in these patients.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) has been proposed to act as a hepatokine that contributes to the extrahepatic complications observed in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, it remains uncertain whether serum SHBG mediates the association between intrahepatic lipids (IHL) and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we studied whether, and to what extent, serum SHBG mediates the association between IHL content and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from the Maastricht Study (n=1554), a population-based cohort study with oversampling of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes status was assessed by oral glucose tolerance test, and IHL content was measured using 3T Dixon MRI. Mediation analyses were performed to assess the role of serum SHBG in mediating the association between IHL content and type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: IHL content was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes in women and men (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.04, 1.14] and OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.08, 1.17], respectively). Serum SHBG significantly mediated the association between IHL content and type 2 diabetes. The contribution of serum SHBG was higher in women (OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.02, 1.07]; proportion mediated 50.9% [95% CI 26.7, 81.3]) than in men (OR 1.02 [95% CI 1.01, 1.03]; proportion mediated 17.2% [95% CI 9.6, 27.6]). Repeat analyses with proxies of type 2 diabetes and adjustment for covariates did not substantially affect the results. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this large-scale population-based cohort study, serum SHBG was found to be a mediator of the association between IHL content and type 2 diabetes. These findings extend our understanding of the potential mechanisms by which NAFLD is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and further elaborate on the role of SHBG as a hepatokine.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PVNH) are developmental abnormalities with neurons abnormally clustered around the cerebral ventricles. Patients frequently present with focal drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, the relationship between PVNH and the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is complex. Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive diagnostic procedure for patients with DRE. In selected patients, the SEEG may be converted into a therapeutic procedure, lesioning the probable (SOZ) with pulsed radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RFTC). The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SEEG-RFTC in a series of DRE patients with PVNH. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with focal DRE related to PVNH and treated with SEEG-guided-RFTC restricted to nodules were prospectively collected between 2016 and 2023 and retrospectively analyzed after a follow-up of at least 12 months. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (71 %) responded (ILAE class 1-4) after SEEG-guided RFTC of whom eleven (46 %) became seizure-free (class 1) at last follow up, nine (45 %) despite residual PVNH tissue on MRI. SEEG seizure onset was restricted to PVNH in eleven patients (class 1 in 45 %) and simultaneously in PVNH and other cortical areas in thirteen patients (class 1 in 46 %). Out of 31 SEEG-RFTC procedures in twenty-four patients, adverse events, related to RFTC, were recorded in eight (26 %), of which two patients (8 %) had predicted permanent visual complaints whilst the other five had transient complaints. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that a considerable percentage of patients, even with bilateral, multiple PVNH and involvement of adjacent cortical regions can be rendered seizure-free with SEEG-guided-RFTC restricted to the nodules. Furthermore, this study delivers evidence that the complete destruction of the entire nodule is not necessary to render a patient seizure free. This justifies the use of SEEG in patients with single, multiple or bilateral PVNHs to provide insight into the epileptogenic organization in and around these lesions.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Given the absence of curative interventions and the rising global incidence of dementia, research is increasingly focusing on lifestyle factors for prevention. However, identifying shared environmental risk for dementia, next to individual factors, is crucial for optimal risk reduction strategies. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the association between air pollution, cognitive functioning, and markers of structural brain damage. METHODS: We used cross-sectional data from 4,002 participants of The Maastricht Study on volumetric markers of brain integrity (white and grey matter volume, cerebrospinal fluid volume, white matter hyperintensities volume, presence of cerebral small vessel disease) and cognitive functioning (memory, executive functioning and attention, processing speed, overall cognition). Individuals were matched by postal code of residence to nationwide data on air pollution exposure (particulate matter < 2.5 mum (PM(2.5)), particulate matter <10 mum (PM(10)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), soot). Potentia linear and non-linear associations were investigated with linear, logistic, and restricted cubic splines regression. All analyses were adjusted for demographic characteristics and a compound score of modifiable dementia risk and protective factors. RESULTS: Exposure to air pollutants was not related to cognitive functioning and most brain markers. We found curvilinear relationships between high PM(2.5) exposures and grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid volume. Participants in the low and high range of exposure had lower grey matter volume. Higher cerebrospinal fluid volumes were only associated with high range of exposure, independent of demographic and individual modifiable dementia risk factors. After additional post hoc analyses, controlling for urbanicity, the associations for grey matter volume became non-significant. In men only, higher exposure to all air pollutants was associated with lower white matter volumes. No significant associations with white matter hyperintensities volume or cerebral small vessel disease were observed. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that higher PM(2.5) exposure is associated with more brain atrophy.},

   abstract = {Sin3A or Sin3B are components of a corepressor complex that mediates repression by transcription factors such as the helix-loop-helix proteins Mad and Mxi. Members of the Mad/Mxi family of repressors play important roles in the transition between proliferation and differentiation by down-regulating the expression of genes that are activated by the proto-oncogene product Myc. Here, we report the solution structure of the second paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domain (PAH2) of Sin3B in complex with a peptide comprising the N-terminal region of Mad1. This complex exhibits a novel interaction fold for which we propose the name 'wedged helical bundle'. Four alpha-helices of PAH2 form a hydrophobic cleft that accommodates an amphipathic Mad1 alpha-helix. Our data further show that, upon binding Mad1, secondary structure elements of PAH2 are stabilized. The PAH2-Mad1 structure provides the basis for determining the principles of protein interaction and selectivity involving PAH domains.},

   abstract = {Compared with conventional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is more prone to thermal noise and motion. Optimized sampling schemes have been proposed that reduce the propagation of noise. At 3 T, however, motion may play a more dominant role than noise. Although the effects of noise at 3 T are less compared with 1.5 T because of the higher signal-to-noise ratio, motion is independent of field strength and will persist. To improve the reliability of clinical DTI at 3 T, it is important to know to what extent noise and motion contribute to the uncertainties of the DTI indices. In this study, the effects of noise- and motion-related signal uncertainties are disentangled using in vivo measurements and computer simulations. For six clinically standard available sampling schemes, the reproducibility was assessed in vivo, with and without motion correction applied. Additionally, motion and noise simulations were performed to determine the relative contributions of motion and noise to the uncertainties of the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA). It is shown that the contributions of noise and motion are of the same order of magnitude at 3 T. Similar to the propagation of noise, the propagation of motion-related signal perturbations is also influenced by the choice of sampling scheme. Sampling schemes with only six diffusion directions demonstrated a lower reproducibility compared with schemes with 15 and 32 directions and feature a positive bias for the FA in relatively isotropic tissue. Motion correction helps improving the precision and accuracy of DTI indices.},

Outcomes comprised BMI, skinfolds, waist circumference (WC), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, DMS), body composition, abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues (CODAM: ultrasound, DMS: MRI) and liver fat (estimated, in CODAM, or MRI-derived, in DMS, liver fat percentage and fatty liver disease). Associations were examined with linear or logistic regressions adjusted for relevant confounders with z-standardized primary exposures and outcomes. RESULTS: Methionine was associated with all measures of liver fat, e.g., fatty liver disease [CODAM: OR = 1.49 (95% CI 1.19, 1.88); DMS: OR = 1.51 (1.09, 2.14)], but not with other fat depots. tCys was associated with overall obesity, e.g., BMI [CODAM: beta = 0.19 (0.09, 0.28); DMS: beta = 0.24 (0.14, 0.34)]; peripheral adiposity, e.g., biceps and triceps skinfolds [CODAM: beta = 0.15 (0.08, 0.23); DMS: beta = 0.20 (0.12, 0.29)]; and central adiposity, e.g., WC [CODAM: beta = 0.16 (0.08, 0.25); DMS: beta = 0.17 (0.08, 0.27)]. Associations of tCys with VAT and liver fat were inconsistent. Other SAAs were not associated with body fat. CONCLUSION: Plasma concentrations of methionine and tCys showed distinct associations with different fat depots, with similar strengths in the two cohorts.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: High cognitive activity possibly reduces the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. AIMS: To investigate associations between an individual's need to engage in cognitively stimulating activities (need for cognition, NFC) and structural brain damage and cognitive functioning in the Dutch general population with and without existing cognitive impairment. METHOD: Cross-sectional data were used from the population-based cohort of the Maastricht Study. NFC was measured using the Need For Cognition Scale. Cognitive functioning was tested in three domains: verbal memory, information processing speed, and executive functioning and attention. Values 1.5 s.d. below the mean were defined as cognitive impairment. Standardised volumes of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and presence of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) were derived from 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple linear and binary logistic regression analyses were used adjusted for demographic, somatic and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Participants (n = 4209; mean age 59.06 years, s.d. = 8.58; 50.1% women) with higher NFC scores had higher overall cognition scores (B = 0.21, 95% CI 0.17-0.26, P < 0.001) and lower odds for CSVD (OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.60-0.91, P = 0.005) and cognitive impairment (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.48-0.76, P < 0.001) after adjustment for demographic, somatic and lifestyle factors. The association between NFC score and cognitive functioning was similar for individuals with and without prevalent cognitive impairment. We found no significant association between NFC and WMH or CSF volumes. CONCLUSIONS: A high need to engage in cognitively stimulating activities is associated with better cognitive functioning and less presence of CSVD and cognitive impairment. This suggests that, in middle-aged individuals, motivation to engage in cognitively stimulating activities may be an opportunity to improve brain health.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Higher magnetic field strength introduces stronger magnetic field inhomogeneities in the brain, especially within temporal lobes, leading to image artifacts. Particularly, T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images can be affected by these artifacts. Here, we aimed to improve the FLAIR image quality in temporal lobe regions through image processing of multiple contrast images via machine learning using a neural network. METHODS: Thirteen drug-resistant MR-negative epilepsy patients (age 29.2 +/- 9.4y, 5 females) were scanned on a 7 T MRI scanner. Magnetization-prepared (MP2RAGE) and saturation-prepared with 2 rapid gradient echoes, multi-echo gradient echo with four echo times, and the FLAIR sequence were acquired. A voxel-wise neural network was trained on extratemporal-lobe voxels from the acquired structural scans to generate a new FLAIR-like image (i.e., deepFLAIR) with reduced temporal lobe inhomogeneities. The deepFLAIR was evaluated in temporal lobes through signal-to-noise (SNR), contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratio, the sharpness of the gray-white matter boundary and joint-histogram analysis. Saliency mapping demonstrated the importance of each input image per voxel. RESULTS: SNR and CNR in both gray and white matter were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the deepFLAIR's temporal ROIs, compared to the FLAIR. The gray-white matter boundary sharpness was either preserved or improved in 10/13 right-sided temporal regions and was found significantly increased in the ROIs. Multiple image contrasts were influential for the deepFLAIR reconstruction with the MP2RAGE second inversion image being the most important. CONCLUSIONS: The deepFLAIR network showed promise to restore the FLAIR signal and reduce contrast attenuation in temporal lobe areas. This may yield a valuable tool, especially when artifact-free FLAIR images are not available.},

   abstract = {Focal epilepsy is a common and severe neurologic disorder. Neuroimaging aims to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ), preferably as a macroscopic structural lesion. For approximately a third of patients with chronic drug-resistant focal epilepsy, the EZ cannot be precisely identified using standard 3.0-T MRI. This may be due to either the EZ being undetectable at imaging or the seizure activity being caused by a physiologic abnormality rather than a structural lesion. Computational image processing has recently been shown to aid radiologic assessments and increase the success rate of uncovering suspicious regions by enhancing their visual conspicuity. While structural image analysis is at the forefront of EZ detection, physiologic image analysis has also been shown to provide valuable information about EZ location. This narrative review summarizes and explains the current state-of-the-art computational approaches for image analysis and presents their potential for EZ detection. Current limitations of the methods and possible future directions to augment EZ detection are discussed.},

   abstract = {Many children with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) have significant cognitive comorbidity, for which the underlying mechanism has not yet been unraveled, but is likely related to disturbed cerebral network integrity. Using resting-state fMRI, we investigated whether cerebral network characteristics are associated with epilepsy and cognitive comorbidity. We included 37 children with FLE and 41 healthy age-matched controls. Cognitive performance was determined by means of a computerized visual searching task. A connectivity matrix for 82 cortical and subcortical brain regions was generated for each subject by calculating the inter-regional correlation of the fMRI time signals. From the connectivity matrix, graph metrics were calculated and the anatomical configuration of aberrant connections and modular organization was investigated. Both patients and controls displayed efficiently organized networks. However, FLE patients displayed a higher modularity, implying that subnetworks are less interconnected. Impaired cognition was associated with higher modularity scores and abnormal modular organization of the brain, which was mainly expressed as a decrease in long-range and an increase in interhemispheric connectivity in patients. We showed that network modularity analysis provides a sensitive marker for cognitive impairment in FLE and suggest that abnormally interconnected functional subnetworks of the brain might underlie the cognitive problems in children with FLE.},

   abstract = {Advances in computational network analysis have enabled the characterization of topological properties in large scale networks including the human brain. Information on structural networks in the brain can be obtained in-vivo by performing tractography on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. However, little is known about the reproducibility of network properties derived from whole brain tractography data, which has important consequences for minimally detectable abnormalities or changes over time. Moreover, acquisition parameters, such as the number of gradient directions and gradient strength, possibly influence network metrics and the corresponding reproducibility derived from tractography data. The aim of the present study is twofold: (i) to determine the effect of several clinically available DTI sampling schemes, differing in number of gradient directions and gradient amplitude, on small world metrics and (ii) to evaluate the interscan reproducibility of small world metrics. DTI experiments were conducted on six healthy volunteers scanned twice. Probabilistic tractography was performed to reconstruct structural connections between regions defined from an anatomical atlas. The observed reproducibility of the network measures was high, reflected by low values for the coefficient of variation (<3.8%), advocating the use of graph theoretical measurements to study neurological diseases. Small world metrics were dependent on the choice of DTI gradient scheme and showed stronger connectivity with increasing directional resolution. The interscan reproducibility was not dependent on the gradient scheme. These findings should be considered when comparing results across studies using different gradient schemes or designing new studies.},

   abstract = {In childhood frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), cognitive impairment and educational underachievement are serious, well-known co-morbidities. The broad scale of affected cognitive domains suggests wide-spread network disturbances that not only involves, but also extends beyond the frontal lobe. In this study we have investigated whole brain connectional properties of children with FLE in relation to their cognitive impairment and compared them with healthy controls. Functional connectivity (FC) of the networks was derived from dynamic fluctuations of resting state fMRI and structural connectivity (SC) was obtained from fiber tractograms of diffusion weighted MRI. The whole brain network was characterized with graph theoretical metrics and decomposed into modules. Subsequently, the graph metrics and the connectivity within and between modules were related to cognitive performance. Functional network disturbances in FLE were related to increased clustering, increased path length, and stronger modularity compared to healthy controls, which was accompanied by stronger within- and weaker between-module functional connectivity. Although structural path length and clustering appeared normal in children with FLE, structural modularity increased with stronger cognitive impairment. It is concluded that decreased coupling between large-scale functional network modules is a hallmark for impaired cognition in childhood FLE.},

   abstract = {Patients with chronic epilepsy frequently display cognitive comorbidity and might have widespread network abnormalities outside the epileptic zone, which might affect a variety of cognitive functions and global intelligence. We aimed to study the role of white matter connectivity in cognitive comorbidity. Thirty-nine patients with nonsymptomatic localization-related epilepsy and varying degrees of cognitive impairment and 23 age-matched healthy controls were included. Whole brain white matter networks were constructed from fiber tractography. Weighted graph theoretical analysis was performed to study white matter network abnormalities associated with epilepsy and cognition. Patients with severe cognitive impairment showed lower clustering (a measure of brain network segregation) and higher path length (a measure of brain network integration) compared with the healthy controls and patients with little or no cognitive impairment, whereas whole brain white matter volume did not differ. Correlation analyses revealed that IQ and cognitive impairment were strongly associated with clustering and path lengths. This study revealed impaired white matter connectivity, associated with cognitive comorbidity in patients with chronic epilepsy. As whole brain white matter volumes were preserved in the patient group, our results suggest an important role for the network topology rather than volumetric changes, in epilepsy with cognitive decline.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Structural brain abnormalities are key risk factors for brain diseases, such as dementia, stroke, and depression, in type 2 diabetes. It is unknown whether structural brain abnormalities already occur in prediabetes. Therefore, we investigated whether both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are associated with lacunar infarcts (LIs), white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), and brain atrophy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from 2,228 participants (1,373 with normal glucose metabolism [NGM], 347 with prediabetes, and 508 with type 2 diabetes (oversampled); mean age 59.2 +/- 8.2 years; 48.3% women) of the Maastricht Study, a population-based cohort study. Diabetes status was determined with an oral glucose tolerance test. Brain imaging was performed with 3 Tesla MRI. Results were analyzed with multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes were associated with the presence of LIs (odds ratio 1.61 [95% CI 0.98-2.63] and 1.67 [1.04-2.68], respectively; P trend = 0.027), larger WMH (beta 0.07 log10-transformed mL [log-mL] [95% CI 0.00-0.15] and 0.21 log-mL [0.14-0.28], respectively; P trend <0.001), and smaller white matter volumes (beta -4.0 mL [-7.3 to -0.6] and -7.2 mL [-10.4 to -4.0], respectively; P trend <0.001) compared with NGM. Prediabetes was not associated with gray matter volumes or the presence of CMBs. CONCLUSIONS: Prediabetes is associated with structural brain abnormalities, with further deterioration in type 2 diabetes. These results indicate that, in middle-aged populations, structural brain abnormalities already occur in prediabetes, which may suggest that the treatment of early dysglycemia may contribute to the prevention of brain diseases.},

   abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with accelerated cognitive decline. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms still remain to be elucidated although it is known that insulin signaling modulates neurotransmitter activity, including inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and excitatory glutamate (Glu) receptors. Therefore, we examined whether levels of GABA and Glu are related to diabetes status and cognitive performance.Forty-one participants with type 2 diabetes and 39 participants without type 2 diabetes underwent detailed cognitive assessments and 3-Tesla proton MR spectroscopy. The associations of neurotransmitters with type 2 diabetes and cognitive performance were examined using multivariate regression analyses controlling for age, sex, education, BMI, and percentage gray/white matter ratio in spectroscopic voxel.Analysis revealed higher GABA+ levels in participants with type 2 diabetes, in participants with higher fasting blood glucose levels and in participants with higher HbA1c levels, and higher GABA+ levels in participants with both high HbA1c levels and less cognitive performance.To conclude, participants with type 2 diabetes have alterations in the GABAergic neurotransmitter system, which are related to lower cognitive functioning, and hint at the involvement of an underlying metabolic mechanism.},

Forty participants with type 2 diabetes and 38 participants without type 2 diabetes underwent detailed cognitive assessment and 3-Tesla diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion MRI was performed to assess microstructure (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) and white matter connectivity (tract volume) of the hippocampus, which were compared between participants with and without type 2 diabetes. No differences in hippocampal microstructure were observed. Participants with type 2 diabetes had fewer white matter connections between the hippocampus and frontal lobe (P = 0.017). Participants who scored lower on memory function, regardless of type 2 diabetes, had fewer white matter connections between the hippocampus and temporal lobe (P = 0.017). Taken together, type 2 diabetes and memory decrements appear to be associated with altered hippocampal white matter connectivity.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is associated with accelerated cognitive decline, especially regarding memory for which the hippocampus plays an essential role. The pathophysiological mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. The purpose of this study is to examine whether hippocampal microvascular and microstructural changes are related to type 2 diabetes (based on status or based on fasting blood glucose [FBG] levels) and verbal memory performance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-nine participants with type 2 diabetes (64.5 +/- 6.1 years old) and 34 participants without type 2 diabetes (58.3 +/- 9.2 years old) underwent detailed cognitive assessments and 3-Tesla MRI using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI. Multivariate regression analyses controlling for age, sex, education level, BMI, systolic blood pressure, hematocrit level, and relative hippocampal volume were performed to examine associations between hippocampal IVIM measures, type 2 diabetes (status and FBG), and memory performance. RESULTS: For the microvasculature, blood perfusion volume (f) was larger in participants with type 2 diabetes, f and blood flow (fD*) increased with higher FBG levels, and microvascular pseudodiffusion (D*) and fD*, which are indicative of altered microvasculature, were higher in participants with both relatively high FBG levels and low memory performance. In addition, fD* increased with lower memory performance. For the parenchymal microstructure, the diffusion (D), indicative of injured microstructure, was higher with reduced memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the parenchymal microstructure, especially the microvascular properties of the hippocampus are altered in participants with both type 2 diabetes and memory problems and possibly hint at an underlying vascular mechanism.},

   abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive decrements, accelerated cognitive decline, and increased risk for dementia. Patients with the metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for diabetes, may display comparable cognitive decrements as seen in type 2 diabetes. Currently, the impact of diabetes and prediabetes on cognition and the underlying organization of functional brain networks still remain to be elucidated. This study investigated whether functional brain networks are affected in type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Forty-seven participants with diabetes, 47 participants with prediabetes, and 45 control participants underwent detailed cognitive testing and 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI. Graph theoretical network analysis was performed to investigate alterations in functional cerebral networks. Participants with diabetes displayed altered network measures, characterized by a higher normalized cluster coefficient and higher local efficiency, compared with control participants. The network measures of the participants with prediabetes fell between those with diabetes and control participants. Lower processing speed was associated with shorter path length and higher global efficiency. Participants with type 2 diabetes have altered functional brain networks. This alteration is already apparent in the prediabetic stage to a somewhat lower level, hinting at functional reorganization of the cerebral networks as a compensatory mechanism for cognitive decrements.},

   abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with accelerated cognitive decline and various cerebral abnormalities visible on MRI. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in diabetes still remain to be elucidated. In addition to conventional images, MRI offers a versatile set of novel contrasts, including blood perfusion, neuronal function, white matter microstructure, and metabolic function. These more-advanced multiparametric MRI contrasts and the pertaining parameters are able to reveal abnormalities in type 2 diabetes, which may be related to cognitive decline. To further elucidate the nature of the link between diabetes, cognitive decline, and brain abnormalities, and changes over time thereof, biomarkers are needed which can be provided by advanced MRI techniques. This review summarizes to what extent MRI, especially advanced multiparametric techniques, can elucidate the underlying neuronal substrate that reflects the cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes.},

   abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment may play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline and dementia. In vivo imaging studies are needed to quantify and localize the BBB defects during life, contemplating the circulatory properties. We reviewed the literature for imaging studies investigating BBB impairment in patients suffering from dementia. After selection, 11 imaging studies were included, of which 6 used contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2 used contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and 3 positron emission tomography (PET). Primarily the MRI studies hint at a subtle increasing permeability of the BBB, particularly in patients already exhibiting cerebrovascular pathology. More elaborate studies are required to provide convincing evidence on BBB impairment in patients with various stages of dementia with and without obvious cerebrovascular pathology. In the future, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI techniques and transport specific imaging using PET may further detail the research on the molecular nature of BBB defects.},

   abstract = {Purpose To investigate whether the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leaks blood-circulating substances in patients with early forms of Alzheimer disease (AD), and if so, to examine the extent and pattern of leakage. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the local medical ethical committees of the Maastricht University Medical Center and Leiden University Medical Center, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. For this pilot study, 16 patients with early AD and 17 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence with dual time resolution for 25 minutes. The Patlak graphical approach was used to quantify the BBB leakage rate and local blood plasma volume. Subsequent histogram analysis was used to determine the volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue. Differences were assessed with linear regression analysis, adjusted for confounding variables. Results The BBB leakage rate was significantly higher in patients compared with that in control subjects in the total gray matter (P < .05) and cortex (P = .03). Patients had a significantly higher volume fraction of the leaking brain tissue in the gray matter (P = .004), normal-appearing white matter (P < .04), deep gray matter (P = .01), and cortex (P = .004). When all subjects were considered, scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination decreased significantly with increasing leakage in the deep gray matter (P = .007) and cortex (P < .05). Conclusion The results of this study showed global BBB leakage in patients with early AD that is associated with cognitive decline. A compromised BBB may be part of a cascade of pathologic events that eventually lead to cognitive decline and dementia. ((c))RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI can be used to measure blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage. In neurodegenerative disorders such as small vessel disease and dementia, the leakage can be very subtle and the corresponding signal can be rather noisy. For these reasons, an optimized DCE-MRI measurement and study design is required. To this end, a new measure indicative of the spatial extent of leakage is introduced and the effects of scan time and sample size are explored. METHODS: Dual-time resolution DCE-MRI was performed in 16 patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 17 healthy controls. The leakage rate (Ki ) and volume fraction of detectable leaking tissue (vL ) to quantify the spatial extent of BBB leakage were calculated in cortical gray matter and white matter using noise-corrected histogram analysis of leakage maps. Computer simulations utilizing realistic Ki histograms, mimicking the strong effect of noise and variation in Ki values, were performed to understand the influence of scan time on the estimated leakage. RESULTS: The mean Ki was very low (order of 10(-4) min(-1) ) and highly influenced by noise, causing the Ki to be increasingly overestimated at shorter scan times. In the white matter, the Ki was not different between patients with early AD and controls, but was higher in the cortex for patients, reaching significance after 14.5 min of scan time. To detect group differences, vL proved more suitable, showing significantly higher values for patients compared with controls in the cortex after 8 minutes of scan time, and in white matter after 15.5 min. CONCLUSIONS: Several ways to improve the sensitivity of a DCE-MRI experiment to subtle BBB leakage were presented. We have provided vL as an attractive and potentially more time-efficient alternative to detect group differences in subtle and widespread blood-brain barrier leakage compared with leakage rate Ki . Recommendations on group size and scan time are made based on statistical power calculations to aid future research.},

   abstract = {The neurovascular unit, which protects neuronal cells and supplies them with essential molecules, plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The aim of this study was to noninvasively investigate 2 linked functional elements of the neurovascular unit, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow (CBF), in patients with early AD and healthy controls. Therefore, both dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging were applied to measure BBB permeability and CBF, respectively. The patients with early AD showed significantly lower CBF and local blood volume in the gray matter, compared with controls. In the patients, we also found that a reduction in CBF is correlated with an increase in leakage rate. This finding supports the hypothesis that neurovascular damage, and in particular impairment of the neurovascular unit constitutes the pathophysiological link between CBF reduction and BBB impairment in AD.},

   abstract = {This literature review presents a comprehensive overview of machine learning (ML) applications in proton MR spectroscopy (MRS). As the use of ML techniques in MRS continues to grow, this review aims to provide the MRS community with a structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we examine and summarize studies published between 2017 and 2023 from major journals in the MR field. We categorize these studies based on a typical MRS workflow, including data acquisition, processing, analysis, and artificial data generation. Our review reveals that ML in MRS is still in its early stages, with a primary focus on processing and analysis techniques, and less attention given to data acquisition. We also found that many studies use similar model architectures, with little comparison to alternative architectures. Additionally, the generation of artificial data is a crucial topic, with no consistent method for its generation. Furthermore, many studies demonstrate that artificial data suffers from generalization issues when tested on in vivo data. We also conclude that risks related to ML models should be addressed, particularly for clinical applications. Therefore, output uncertainty measures and model biases are critical to investigate. Nonetheless, the rapid development of ML in MRS and the promising results from the reviewed studies justify further research in this field.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD), cognitive impairment is an important non-motor symptom heralding the development of dementia. Effective treatments to slow down the rate of cognitive decline in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment are lacking. Here, we describe the design of the Parkin'Play study, which assesses the effects of a cognitive health game intervention on cognition in PD. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a multicentre, phase-II, open-randomized clinical trial that aims to recruit 222 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment. Eligible patients have PD, Hoehn & Yahr stages I-III, are aged between 40 and 75 years, and have cognitive impairment but no dementia. The intervention group (n = 111) will be trained using a web-based health game targeting multiple cognitive domains. The control group (n = 111) will be placed on a waiting list. In order to increase compliance the health game adapts to the subjects' performance, is enjoyable, and can be played at home. From each group, 20 patients will undergo fMRI to test for potential functional brain changes underlying treatment. The primary outcome after 12 weeks of training is cognitive function, as assessed by a standard neuropsychological assessment battery and an online cognitive assessment. The neuropsychological assessment battery covers the following domains: executive function, memory, visual perception, visuoconstruction and language. A compound score for overall cognitive function will be calculated as the mean score of all test Z-scores based on the distribution of scores for both groups taken together. Secondary outcomes at follow-up visits up to 24 weeks include various motor and non-motor symptoms, compliance, and biological endpoints (fMRI). DISCUSSION: This study aims at evaluating whether a cognitive intervention among PD patients leads to an increased cognitive performance on targeted domains. Strengths of this study are a unique web-based health game intervention, the large sample size, a control group without intervention and innovations designed to increase compliance.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with high mortality due to intracranial pressure (ICP). Whether computed tomography (CT) scanning of the brain within the first 24 h is indicative of intracranial hypertension is largely unknown. We assessed the feasibility of semi-automated CT segmentation in comparison with invasive ICP measurements. RELEVANCE: CT volumetry of the brain might provide ICP data when invasive monitoring is not possible or is undesirable. METHODS: We identified 33 patients with TBI who received a CT scan at admission and ICP monitoring within 24 h. Semi-automated segmentation of CT images in Matlab yielded cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intracranial volume (ICV) data. The ratio CSF/ICV x 100 (expressed as a percentage) was used as a proxy for ICP. The association between invasive ICP and the CSF/ICV ratio was evaluated using a simple linear regression model and a mono-exponential function derived from previous research in animals. RESULTS: ICP is moderately but significantly associated with the CSF/ICV ratio (r = -0.44, p = 0.01). The mono-exponential function provided a better fit of the relationship between ICP and the CSF/ICV ratio than the linear model. CONCLUSION: Our feasibility TBI data show that cross-sectional volumetric CT measures are associated with ICP. This non-invasive method can be used in future studies to monitor patients who are not candidates for invasive monitoring or to evaluate therapy effects objectively.},

   abstract = {Alopecia areata is an unpredictable hair-loss condition. As there is no cure for alopecia areata and no effective conventional therapy, a substantial number of alopecia areata patients resort to complementary and alternative medical remedies and therapies (CAM). This review on the application of CAM in alopecia areata addresses two pertinent aspects. First, it provides a current overview of the published medical literature on CAM used in alopecia areata, and alopecia areata-related studies. Second, it presents a thorough assessment of the considerations and limitations of the use of CAM for the treatment of alopecia areata. A systematic MEDLINE search yielded 13 studies of the clinical use of CAM in the management of alopecia areata, all belonging to one of the five main categories of CAM. Methodological quality was analyzed using objective assessment scores (Wilson and Lawrence scores). Unfortunately, no study was of sufficient internal validity to provide robust evidence of the benefit of CAM. This might be attributable to several specific disease characteristics of alopecia areata, which require an especially solid trial design to properly assess the therapeutic effects of CAM. The review concludes with some recommendations for improving the quality of trials incorporating CAM in the treatment of alopecia areata.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity is presumed to be impaired in hypertension, resulting from cerebral endothelial dysfunction. Hypertension precedes various cerebrovascular diseases, such as cerebral small vessel disease, and is a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases for which BBB disruption is a preceding pathophysiological process. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the relation between hypertension, current blood pressure, and BBB leakage in human subjects. METHODS: BBB leakage was determined in 22 patients with hypertension and 19 age- and sex-matched normotensive controls (median age [range], 65 [45-80] years; 19 men) using a sparsely time-sampled contrast-enhanced 7T magnetic resonance imaging protocol. Structural cerebral small vessel disease markers were visually rated. Multivariable regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and cerebral small vessel disease markers, were performed to determine the relation between hypertension status, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, drug treatment, and BBB leakage. RESULTS: Both hypertensive and normotensive participants showed mild scores of cerebral small vessel disease. BBB leakage did not differ between hypertensive and normotensive participants; however, it was significantly higher for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure in the cortex, and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure in the gray matter. Effectively treated patients showed less BBB leakage than those with current hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: BBB integrity in the total and cortical gray matter decreases with increasing blood pressure but is not related to hypertension status. These findings show that BBB disruption already occurs with increasing blood pressure, before the presence of overt cerebral tissue damage. Additionally, our results suggest that effective antihypertensive medication has a protective effect on the BBB. REGISTRATION: URL: https://trialsearch.who.int/; Unique identifier: NL7537.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: 7 T MRI enables measurements of blood flow velocity waveforms in small, perforating cerebral arteries. As these vessels can be tortuous, acquisition methods sensitive to flow in only one direction may not be sufficient to accurately determine the dynamic blood flow velocity. In this study, we compared 1D with 3D velocity encoding to measure the blood flow velocity and pulsatility in the lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs). METHODS: Blood flow velocity waveforms were measured in the LSAs of 18 subjects (age range: 20-74 years) using prospectively gated single-slice phase contrast (PC) MRI at 7 T. For each subject blood flow velocity waveforms were acquired in a single slice with one velocity encoding as well as three orthogonal velocity encodings. The peak velocity and pulsatility index (PI) were determined in the largest, perpendicularly planned LSA, one obliquely planned LSA and three smaller LSAs. The peak velocity and PI were compared between 1D and 3D measurements using Bland-Altman analysis, with the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) taken into account. RESULTS: For the largest, perpendicularly planned LSA, the peak velocity was slightly lower (0.2 cm/s, 1.7%) for 1D compared to 3D measurements, with an LOA range from the mean difference of (-0.27;0.27). The PI was slightly higher (0.01, 1.6%) for the 1D measurement, and an LOA range from the mean difference in PI of (-0.045;0.045). The obliquely planned LSA and three smaller LSAs demonstrated larger deviations (range mean percentage difference: 3.9-8.2%). CONCLUSION: 1D velocity encoding using 2D PC MRI provides sufficiently accurate dynamic velocity and pulsatility measurements in slices perpendicularly planned to single, large LSAs compared to 3D velocity encoding, while increasing errors are obtained with obliquely planned slices. A greater error is indicated when measuring multiple (possibly tortuous or obliquely planned) smaller LSAs in one scan using one-directional single-slice PC MRI.},

However, the pathophysiological process is not yet well understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the pulsatility measures in small perforating arteries and hypertension, since hypertension-induced arterial stiffening may lead to a higher blood flow pulsatility and lower damping. METHODS: We examined 28 patients with essential hypertension and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age: 63.4, range: 43-81 years, 26 males). Blood flow velocity waveforms were acquired in the lenticulostriate arteries (LSAs) and the middle cerebral artery using phase-contrast MRI at 7 Tesla. Several cerebral small vessel disease markers were scored. The velocity and pulsatility measures were compared between the hypertensives and controls. RESULTS: A higher pulsatility index in the LSAs and a lower damping factor was found in the hypertensive compared to the normotensive group (P=0.015, P=0.015, respectively), but no association was found for the pulsatility index in the middle cerebral artery. Higher systolic and mean arterial pressures were associated with higher pulsatility index in the lenticulostriate artery and damping factor. For diastolic blood pressure, only an association with a lower damping factor was found. Adjusting for cerebral small vessel disease score did not alter these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a higher pulsatility index in the LSAs and a lower damping factor in subjects with hypertension, independent of cerebral small vessel disease presence. This supports the hypothesis that hypertension-induced arterial remodeling may alter the intracerebral blood flow velocity profiles, which could eventually contribute to cerebral tissue damage.

   abstract = {Arterial walls stiffen with age, cardiovascular risk factors, and various vascular diseases, which may lead to less damping of the arterial blood flow pulse, subsequent microvascular damage, and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS). However, the exact interplay between these processes is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relation between blood flow velocity pulsatility in the small lenticulostriate arteries and their supplying middle cerebral artery and the respective damping factor (DF), with the number of MRI-visible PVS in elderly subjects. Blood flow velocity waveforms were obtained in 45 subjects (median age [range]: 64 [48-81] years, 47% male) using 7T MRI. PVS were scored in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO). Spearman correlation analyses were used to determine associations of the blood flow pulsatility and the DF, with PVS score, adjusted for age and sex. We found a significant association between a lower DF and a higher number of PVS in the BG (r(s) = -0.352, P = 0.021), but not in the CSO. This finding supports the supposed pathophysiological mechanism in which excessive kinetic energy deposition leads to damage of small perforating arteries and contributes to the enlargement of PVS at the level of the BG, but possible other pathways might also be of influence.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is commonly measured with DCE-MRI using continuous dynamic scanning. For precise measurement of subtle BBB leakage, a long acquisition time (>20 minutes) is required. As extravasation of the contrast agent is slow, discrete sampling at strategic time points might be beneficial, and gains scan time for additional sequences. Here, we aimed to explore the feasibility of a sparsely sampled MRI protocol at 7 T. METHODS: The scan protocol consisted of a precontrast quantitative T1 measurement, using an MP2RAGE sequence, and after contrast agent injection, a fast-sampling dynamic gradient-echo perfusion scan and two postcontrast quantitative T1 measurements were applied. Simulations were conducted to determine the optimal postcontrast sampling time points for measuring subtle BBB leakage. The graphical Patlak approach was used to quantify the leakage rate (Ki ) and blood plasma volume (vp ) of normal-appearing white and gray matter. RESULTS: The simulations showed that two postcontrast T1 maps are sufficient to detect subtle leakage, and most sensitive when the last T1 map is acquired late, approximately 30 minutes, after contrast agent administration. The in vivo measurements found Ki and vp values in agreement with other studies, and significantly higher values in gray matter compared with white matter (both p = .04). CONCLUSION: The sparsely sampled protocol was demonstrated to be sensitive to quantify subtle BBB leakage, despite using only three T1 maps. Due to the time-efficiency of this method, it will become more feasible to incorporate BBB leakage measurements in clinical research MRI protocols.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microvascular dysfunction (MVD) is an important contributor to major clinical disease such as stroke, dementia, depression, retinopathy, and chronic kidney disease. Alcohol consumption may be a determinant of MVD. OBJECTIVE: Main objectives were (1) to study whether alcohol consumption was associated with MVD as assessed in the brain, retina, skin, kidney and in the blood; and (2) to investigate whether associations differed by history of cardiovascular disease or sex. DESIGN: We used cross-sectional data from The Maastricht Study (N = 3,120 participants, 50.9% men, mean age 60 years, and 27.5% with type 2 diabetes [the latter oversampled by design]). We used regression analyses to study the association between total alcohol (per unit and in the categories, i.e. none, light, moderate, high) and MVD, where all measures of MVD were combined into a total MVD composite score (expressed in SD). We adjusted all associations for potential confounders; and tested for interaction by sex, and history of cardiovascular disease. Additionally we tested for interaction with glucose metabolism status. RESULTS: The association between total alcohol consumption and MVD was non-linear, i.e. J-shaped. Moderate versus light total alcohol consumption was significantly associated with less MVD, after full adjustment (beta [95% confidence interval], -0.10 [-0.19; -0.01]). The shape of the curve differed with sex (P(interaction) = 0.03), history of cardiovascular disease (P(interaction) < 0.001), and glucose metabolism status (P(interaction) = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The present cross-sectional, population-based study found evidence that alcohol consumption may have an effect on MVD. Hence, although increasing alcohol consumption cannot be recommended as a policy, this study suggests that prevention of MVD may be possible through dietary interventions.},

   abstract = {Many Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are suffering from long-term neuropsychological sequelae. These patients may benefit from a better understanding of the underlying neuropathophysiological mechanisms and identification of potential biomarkers and treatment targets. Structural clinical neuroimaging techniques have limited ability to visualize subtle cerebral abnormalities and to investigate brain function. This scoping review assesses the merits and potential of advanced neuroimaging techniques in COVID-19 using literature including advanced neuroimaging or postmortem analyses in adult COVID-19 patients published from the start of the pandemic until December 2023. Findings were summarized according to distinct categories of reported cerebral abnormalities revealed by different imaging techniques. Although no unified COVID-19-specific pattern could be subtracted, a broad range of cerebral abnormalities were revealed by advanced neuroimaging (likely attributable to hypoxic, vascular, and inflammatory pathology), even in absence of structural clinical imaging findings. These abnormalities are validated by postmortem examinations. This scoping review emphasizes the added value of advanced neuroimaging compared to structural clinical imaging and highlights implications for brain functioning and long-term consequences in COVID-19.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurological complications in COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) have been previously reported. As the pandemic progressed, therapeutic strategies were tailored to new insights. This study describes the incidence, outcome, and types of reported neurological complications in invasively mechanically ventilated (IMV) COVID-19 patients in relation to three periods during the pandemic. METHODS: IMV COVID-19 ICU patients from the Dutch Maastricht Intensive Care COVID (MaastrICCht) cohort were included in a single-center study (March 2020 - October 2021). Demographic, clinical, and follow-up data were collected. Electronic medical records were screened for neurological complications during hospitalization. Three distinct periods (P1, P2, P3) were defined, corresponding to periods with high hospitalization rates. ICU survivors with and without reported neurological complications were compared in an exploratory analysis. RESULTS: IMV COVID-19 ICU patients (n=324; median age 64 [IQR 57-72] years; 238 males (73.5%)) were stratified into P1 (n=94), P2 (n=138), and P3 (n=92). ICU mortality did not significantly change over time (P1=38.3%; P2=41.3%; P3=37.0%; p=.787). The incidence of reported neurological complications during ICU admission gradually decreased over the periods (P1=29.8%; P2=24.6%; P3=18.5%; p=.028). Encephalopathy/delirium (48/324 (14.8%)) and ICU-acquired weakness (32/324 (9.9%)) were most frequently reported and associated with ICU treatment intensity. ICU survivors with neurological complications (n=53) were older (p=.025), predominantly male (p=.037), and had a longer duration of IMV (p<.001) and ICU stay (p<.001), compared to survivors without neurological complications (n=132). A multivariable analysis revealed that only age was independently associated with the occurrence of neurological complications (OR(adj)=1.0541; 95% CI=1.0171-1.0925; p=.004). Health-related quality-of-life at follow-up was not significantly different between survivors with and without neurological complications (n = 82, p=.054). CONCLUSIONS: A high but decreasing incidence of neurological complications was reported during three consecutive COVID-19 periods in IMV COVID-19 patients. Neurological complications were related to the intensity of ICU support and treatment, and associated with prolonged ICU stay, but did not lead to significantly worse reported health-related quality-of-life at follow-up.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dissociation is a mental process with psychological and somatoform manifestations, which is closely related to hypnotic suggestibility and essentially shows the ability to obtain distance from reality. An increased tendency to dissociate is a frequently reported characteristic of patients with functional neurological symptoms and syndromes (FNSS), which account for a substantial part of all neurological admissions. This review aims to investigate what heart rate variability (HRV), EEG and neuroimaging data (MRI) reveal about the nature of dissociation and related conditions. METHODS: Studies reporting HRV, EEG and neuroimaging data related to hypnosis, dissociation and FNSS were identified by searching the electronic databases Pubmed and ScienceDirect. RESULTS: The majority of the identified studies concerned the physiological characteristics of hypnosis; relatively few investigations on dissociation related FNSS were identified. General findings were increased parasympathetic functioning during hypnosis (as measured by HRV), and lower HRV in patients with FNSS. The large variety of EEG and functional MRI investigations with diverse results challenges definite conclusions, but evidence suggests that subcortical as well as (pre)frontal regions serve emotion regulation in dissociative conditions. Functional connectivity analyses suggest the presence of altered brain networks in patients with FNSS, in which limbic areas have an increased influence on motor preparatory regions. CONCLUSIONS: HRV, EEG and (functional) MRI are sensitive methods to detect physiological changes related to dissociation and dissociative disorders such as FNSS, and can possibly provide more information about their aetiology. The use of such measures could eventually provide biomarkers for earlier identification of patients at risk and appropriate treatment of dissociative conditions.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) resemble epileptic seizures, but lack epileptiform brain activity. Instead, the cause is assumed to be psychogenic. An abnormal coping strategy may be exhibited by PNES patients, as indicated by their increased tendency to dissociate. Investigation of resting-state networks may reveal altered routes of information and emotion processing in PNES patients. The authors therefore investigated whether PNES patients differ from healthy controls in their resting-state functional connectivity characteristics and whether these connections are associated with the tendency to dissociate. METHODS: 11 PNES patients without psychiatric comorbidity and 12 healthy controls underwent task-related paradigms (picture-encoding and Stroop paradigms) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Global cognitive performance was tested using the Raven's Matrices test and participants completed questionnaires for evaluating dissociation. Functional connectivity analysis on rsfMRI was based on seed regions extracted from task-related fMRI activation maps. RESULTS: The patients displayed a significantly lower cognitive performance and significantly higher dissociation scores. No significant differences were found between the picture-encoding and Stroop colour-naming activation maps between controls and patients with PNES. However, functional connectivity maps from the rsfMRI were statistically different. For PNES patients, stronger connectivity values between areas involved in emotion (insula), executive control (inferior frontal gyrus and parietal cortex) and movement (precentral sulcus) were observed, which were significantly associated with dissociation scores. CONCLUSION: The abnormal, strong functional connectivity in PNES patients provides a neurophysiological correlate for the underlying psychoform and somatoform dissociation mechanism where emotion can influence executive control, resulting in altered motor function (eg, seizure-like episodes).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are epilepsy-like episodes which have an emotional rather than organic origin. Although PNES have often been related to the process of dissociation, the psychopathology is still poorly understood. To elucidate underlying mechanisms, the current study applied independent component analysis (ICA) on resting-state fMRI to investigate alterations within four relevant networks, associated with executive, fronto-parietal, sensorimotor, and default mode activation, and within a visual network to examine specificity of between-group differences. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with PNES without psychiatric or neurologic comorbidities and twenty-seven healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MR imaging at 3.0T (Philips Achieva). Additional neuropsychological testing included Raven's Matrices test and dissociation questionnaires. ICA with dual regression was used to identify resting-state networks in all participants, and spatial maps of the networks of interest were compared between patients and healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients displayed higher dissociation scores, lower cognitive performance and increased contribution of the orbitofrontal, insular and subcallosal cortex in the fronto-parietal network; the cingulate and insular cortex in the executive control network; the cingulate gyrus, superior parietal lobe, pre- and postcentral gyri and supplemental motor cortex in the sensorimotor network; and the precuneus and (para-) cingulate gyri in the default-mode network. The connectivity strengths within these regions of interest significantly correlated with dissociation scores. No between-group differences were found within the visual network, which was examined to determine specificity of between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: PNES patients displayed abnormalities in several resting-state networks that provide neuronal correlates for an underlying dissociation mechanism.},

   abstract = {Objective: Little is known about the (peri-) ictal changes in autonomic nervous system activity of epileptic
seizures. Such information may be useful for seizure prediction paradigms and differential diagnosis between
epilepsy and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). The current study investigated the peri-ictal time course of
heart rate variability (HRV) measures, which reflect autonomic nervous system functioning.
Methods: HRV measures were extracted from electrocardiography data collected during 1-7 days of videoelectroencephalography
monitoring of 17 patients with epilepsy and 20 patients with PNES. Heart rate (HR) and
HRV measures (standard deviation of average beat-to-beat intervals (SDANN), root mean square of successive
differences (RMSSD), high frequency (HF) power, low frequency (LF) power and very low frequency (VLF) power)
were averaged over consecutive five-minute intervals. Quantitative analyses of Poincaré plot parameters (SD1, SD2
and SD1/SD2 ratio) were also performed. In addition, differences with HRV parameters of patients with PNES were
explored.
Results: In epilepsy, no significant pre-ictal changes in HR and HRV parameters were observed. During
seizures, HR, SDANN, SD1 and SD1/SD2 ratio significantly increased while VLF power significantly decreased. In
the five-minute interval immediately following seizures, HR, SDANN and SD1 were back to pre-seizure levels, while
VLF power remained significantly decreased and SD1/SD2 ratio remained significantly increased. Significant
between-group differences were identified for several pre-ictal and ictal HRV parameters, but not for post-ictal
measurements.
Conclusion: The ictal HR and HRV changes reflect increased sympathetic system activation during epileptic
seizures. The HRV parameters of patients with epilepsy differed significantly from the peri-ictal HRV pattern of
patients with PNES, which suggested increased sympathetic system activation and decreased vagal tone shortly
before PNES and return to normal levels shortly after the episode. Implications for differential diagnosis and
treatment are discussed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) resemble epileptic seizures but originate from psychogenic rather than organic causes. Patients with PNESs are often unable or unwilling to reflect on underlying emotions. To gain more insight into the internal states of patients during PNES episodes, this study explored the time course of heart rate variability (HRV) measures, which provide information about autonomic nervous system functioning and arousal. METHODS: Heart rate variability measures were extracted from double-lead electrocardiography data collected during 1-7days of video-electroencephalography monitoring of 20 patients with PNESs, in whom a total number of 118 PNESs was recorded. Heart rate (HR) and HRV measures in time and frequency domains (standard deviation of average beat-to-beat intervals (SDANN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high-frequency (HF) power, low-frequency (LF) power, and very low-frequency (VLF) power) were averaged over consecutive five-minute intervals. Additionally, quantitative analyses of Poincare plot parameters (SD1, SD2, and SD1/SD2 ratio) were performed. RESULTS: In the five-minute interval before PNES, HR significantly (p<0.05) increased (d=2.5), whereas SDANN (d=-0.03) and VLF power (d=-0.05) significantly decreased. During PNES, significant increases in HF power (d=0.0006), SD1 (d=0.031), and SD2 (d=0.016) were observed. In the five-minute interval immediately following PNES, SDANN (d=0.046) and VLF power (d=0.073) significantly increased, and HR (d=-5.1) and SD1/SD2 ratio (d=-0.14) decreased, compared to the interval preceding PNES. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that PNES episodes are preceded by increased sympathetic functioning, which is followed by an increase in parasympathetic functioning during and after PNES. Future research needs to identify the exact nature of the increased arousal that precedes PNES.},

   abstract = {The cerebral waste clearance system (i.e, glymphatic or intramural periarterial drainage) works through a network of perivascular spaces (PVS). Dysfunction of this system likely contributes to aggregation of Amyloid-beta and subsequent toxic plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising, non-invasive technique to study this system is MRI, though applications in dementia are still scarce. This review focusses on recent non-contrast enhanced (non-CE) MRI techniques which determine and visualise physiological aspects of the clearance system at multiple levels, i.e., cerebrospinal fluid flow, PVS-flow and interstitial fluid movement. Furthermore, various MRI studies focussing on aspects of the clearance system which are relevant to AD are discussed, such as studies on ageing, sleep alterations, and cognitive decline. Additionally, the complementary function of non-CE to CE methods is elaborated upon. We conclude that non-CE studies have great potential to determine which parts of the waste clearance system are affected by AD and in which stages of cognitive impairment dysfunction of this system occurs, which could allow future clinical trials to target these specific mechanisms.},

   abstract = {The vascular and neurodegenerative processes related to clinical dementia cause cell loss which induces, amongst others, an increase in interstitial fluid (ISF). We assessed microvascular, parenchymal integrity, and a proxy of ISF volume alterations with intravoxel incoherent motion imaging in 21 healthy controls and 53 memory clinic patients - mainly affected by neurodegeneration (mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia), vascular pathology (vascular cognitive impairment), and presumed to be without significant pathology (subjective cognitive decline). The microstructural components were quantified with spectral analysis using a non-negative least squares method. Linear regression was employed to investigate associations of these components with hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes. In the normal appearing white matter, a large fint (a proxy of ISF volume) was associated with a large WMH volume and low hippocampal volume. Likewise, a large fint value was associated with a lower hippocampal volume in the hippocampi. Large ISF volume (fint) was shown to be a prominent factor associated with both WMHs and neurodegenerative abnormalities in memory clinic patients and is argued to play a potential role in impaired glymphatic functioning.},

   abstract = {Three-component intravoxel incoherent motion (3C-IVIM) imaging with spectral analysis provides a proxy for interstitial fluid (ISF) (e.g., in perivascular spaces (PVS), granting a potential marker for altered cerebral clearance. When 3C-IVIM images are acquired with three orthogonal diffusion-sensitizing directions, these are often averaged into the Trace image. This may result in loss of valuable direction-specific information, particularly in PVS-rich regions (basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO)). This study assessed the dependence of individual diffusion-sensitizing directions to the ISF fraction in PVS-rich regions. Additionally, we explored the value of diffusion direction-specific information on ISF characteristics in distinguishing thirty-one patients with cognitive impairment (CI) (Alzheimer's disease (n = 15) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (n = 16)) from thirty cognitively healthy elderly controls (CON). Multi-b-value diffusion-weighted images were acquired in three orthogonal directions (L-R (left-right), A-P (anterior-posterior) and S-I (superior-inferior)) at 3 T. Voxel-based spectral analysis using non-negative least squares was conducted to independently analyze the L-R, A-P, S-I, and Trace images. 3C-IVIM measures were first compared between diffusion-sensitizing directions and the Trace within the BG using repeated measures ANOVA. Subsequently, the 3C-IVIM measures were compared per direction between the CI and CSO group in the BG and CSO with multivariable linear regression. Our results show that the ISF fraction significantly differs between all diffusion-sensitizing directions and Trace in the BG, with the highest ISF fraction detected using S-I. Solely using S-I, a higher ISF fraction was identified in CI compared to CON in the BG (p = .020) and CSO (p = .046). Thereby, this study found that the measured ISF fraction depends on the acquired diffusion-sensitizing direction, where S-I is most sensitive to detect ISF and differences between CI and CON. The Trace approach is not always sensitive enough to ISF characteristics. Solely acquiring S-I may offer an alternative to reduce scanning time.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is one of the assumed pathophysiological mechanisms underlying vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). We investigated the association between baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cognitive decline after 2 years in patients with VCI and reference participants. METHODS: One hundred eighty-one participants (mean age 66.3 +/- 7.4 years, 43.6% women) underwent arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessment at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. We determined the association between baseline global and lobar CBF and cognitive decline with multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: Lower global CBF at baseline was associated with more global cognitive decline in VCI and reference participants. This association was most profound in the domain of attention/psychomotor speed. Lower temporal and frontal CBF at baseline were associated with more cognitive decline in memory. DISCUSSION: Our study supports the role of hypoperfusion in the pathophysiological and clinical progression of VCI. HIGHLIGHTS: Impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) at baseline is associated with faster cognitive decline in VCI and normal aging. Our results suggest that low CBF precedes and contributes to the development of vascular cognitive impairment. CBF determined by ASL might be used as a biomarker to monitor disease progression or treatment responses in VCI.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a late consequence of cerebral microvascular dysfunction (MVD). MVD is hard to measure in the brain due to its limited accessibility. Extracerebral MVD (eMVD) measures can give insights in the etiology of cerebral MVD, as MVD may be a systemic process. We aim to investigate whether a compound score consisting of several eMVD measures is associated with structural cSVD MRI markers. METHODS: Cross-sectional data of the population-based Maastricht Study was used (n = 1872, mean age 59 +/- 8 years, 49% women). Measures of eMVD included flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation response (retina), albuminuria and glomerular filtration rate (kidney), heat-induced skin hyperemia (skin), and plasma biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sE-selectin, and von Willebrand factor). These measures were standardized into z scores and summarized into a compound score. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between the compound score and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and the presence of lacunes and microbleeds, as measured by brain MRI. RESULTS: The eMVD compound score was associated with WMH volume independent of age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors (St beta 0.057 [95% CI 0.010-0.081], p value 0.01), but not with the presence of lacunes (OR 1.011 [95% CI 0.803-1.273], p value 0.92) or microbleeds (OR 1.055 [95% CI 0.896-1.242], p value 0.52). CONCLUSION: A compound score of eMVD is associated with WMH volume. Further research is needed to expand the knowledge about the role of systemic MVD in the pathophysiology of cSVD.},

   abstract = {Cerebral microvascular rarefaction, the reduction in number of functional or structural small blood vessels in the brain, is thought to play an important role in the early stages of microvascular related brain disorders. A better understanding of its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and methods to measure microvascular density in the human brain are needed to develop biomarkers for early diagnosis and to identify targets for disease modifying treatments. Therefore, we provide an overview of the assumed main pathophysiological processes underlying cerebral microvascular rarefaction and the evidence for rarefaction in several microvascular related brain disorders. A number of advanced physiological MRI techniques can be used to measure the pathological alterations associated with microvascular rarefaction. Although more research is needed to explore and validate these MRI techniques in microvascular rarefaction in brain disorders, they provide a set of promising future tools to assess various features relevant for rarefaction, such as cerebral blood flow and volume, vessel density and radius and blood-brain barrier leakage.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The easily accessible retinal vessels provide a unique opportunity to study a proxy for cerebral small vessels. Associations between retinal vessel diameters and macrostructural brain white matter changes have already been demonstrated. Alterations in microvascular function, likely precede these structural abnormalities. We examined whether retinal microvascular function is related to cerebral microvascular properties, assessed by the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) effect in brain MRI. METHODS: Seventy participants (age 60 +/- 8 years, 41% women) from the population-based Maastricht Study underwent brain IVIM diffusion imaging (3 Tesla) to determine the microvascular measures f (perfusion volume fraction) and D* (pseudo-diffusion of circulating blood). The retinal arteriolar and venular dilation response to flicker light stimulation were measured by a dynamic vessel analyzer. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate associations between retinal vasoreactivity and IVIM measures in white matter hyperintensities (WMH), normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and cortical gray matter (CGM). RESULTS: More retinal arteriolar dilation was significantly associated with stronger pseudo-diffusion (D*) in the NAWM and CGM (beta 0.280 [95% CI 0.084-0.475], and beta 0.310 [95% CI 0.091-0.528], respectively), but not with the cerebral blood volume fraction (f). No associations were observed between retinal venular dilation response and cerebrovascular IVIM measures. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in retinal arteriolar microvascular function and microcirculatory properties in the brain are linked. The retina could serve as a proxy for early detection of brain microvascular dysfunction.},

   abstract = {Growing evidence indicates an important role of neurovascular unit (NVU) dysfunction in the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). Individually measurable functions of the NVU have been correlated with cognitive function, but a combined analysis is lacking. We aimed to perform a unified analysis of NVU function and its relation with cognitive performance. The relationship between NVU function in the white matter and cognitive performance (both latent variables composed of multiple measurable variables) was investigated in 73 patients with cSVD (mean age 70 +/- 10 years, 41% women) using canonical correlation analysis. MRI-based NVU function measures included (1) the intravoxel incoherent motion derived perfusion volume fraction (f) and microvascular diffusivity (D*), reflecting cerebral microvascular flow; (2) the IVIM derived intermediate volume fraction (f(int)), indicative of the perivascular clearance system; and (3) the dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI derived blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage rate (K(i)) and leakage volume fraction (V(L)), reflecting BBB integrity. Cognitive performance was composed of 13 cognitive test scores. Canonical correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between the latent variables NVU function and cognitive performance (r 0.73; p = 0.02). For the NVU, the dominating variables were D*, f(int), and K(i). Cognitive performance was driven by multiple cognitive tests comprising different cognitive domains. The functionality of the NVU is correlated with cognitive performance in cSVD. Instead of focusing on individual pathophysiological mechanisms, future studies should target NVU dysfunction as a whole to acquire a coherent understanding of the complex disease mechanisms that occur in the NVU in cSVD.Trial registration: NTR3786 (Dutch Trial Register).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risks of cognitive dysfunction and brain abnormalities. The extent to which risk factor modification can mitigate these risks is unclear. We investigated the associations between incident dementia, cognitive performance, and brain abnormalities among individuals with type 2 diabetes, according to the number of risk factors on target, compared with control subjects without diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective data were from UK Biobank of 87,856 individuals (n = 10,663 diabetes, n = 77,193 control subjects; baseline 2006-2010), with dementia follow-up until February 2018. Individuals with diabetes were categorized according to the number of seven selected risk factors within the guideline-recommended target range (nonsmoking; guideline-recommended levels of glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, BMI, albuminuria, physical activity, and diet). Outcomes were incident dementia, domain-specific cognitive performance, white matter hyperintensities, and total brain volume. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 9.0 years, 147 individuals (1.4%) with diabetes and 412 control subjects (0.5%) had incident dementia. Among individuals with diabetes, excess dementia risk decreased stepwise for a higher number of risk factors on target. Compared with control subjects (incidence rate per 1,000 person-years 0.62 [95% CI 0.56; 0.68]), individuals with diabetes who had five to seven risk factors on target had no significant excess dementia risk (absolute rate difference per 1,000 person-years 0.20 [-0.11; 0.52]; hazard ratio 1.32 [0.89; 1.95]). Similarly, differences in processing speed, executive function, and brain volumes were progressively smaller for a higher number of risk factors on target. These results were replicated in the Maastricht Study. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with diabetes, excess dementia risk, lower cognitive performance, and brain abnormalities decreased stepwise for a higher number of risk factors on target.},

Here, we elaborate on the Mad-Sin3 interaction based on a binding study, solution structure, and dynamics of the PAH2 domain of mSin3 in complex to an extended Sin3 interacting domain (SID) of 24 residues of Mad1. We show that SID residues Met7 and Glu23, outside the previously defined minimal binding motif, mediate additional hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with PAH2. On the basis of these results we propose an extended consensus sequence describing the PAH2-SID interaction specifically for the Mad family, showing that residues outside the hydrophobic core of the SID interact with PAH2 and modulate binding affinity to appropriate levels.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is an urgent need for biomarkers identifying individuals at risk of early-stage cognitive impairment. Using cross-sectional data from The Maastricht Study, this study included 197 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 200 cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 40 to 75, matched by age, sex, and educational level. METHODS: We assessed the association of plasma sphingolipid and ceramide transfer protein (CERT) levels with MCI and adjusted for potentially confounding risk factors. Furthermore, the relationship of plasma sphingolipids and CERTs with magnetic resonance imaging brain volumes was assessed and age- and sex-stratified analyses were performed. RESULTS: Associations of plasma ceramide species C18:0 and C24:1 and combined plasma ceramide chain lengths (ceramide risk score) with MCI were moderated by sex, but not by age, and higher levels were associated with MCI in men. No associations were found among women. In addition, higher levels of ceramide C20:0, C22:0, and C24:1, but not the ceramide risk score, were associated with larger volume of the hippocampus after controlling for covariates, independent of MCI. Although higher plasma ceramide C18:0 was related to higher plasma CERT levels, no association of CERT levels was found with MCI or brain volumes. DISCUSSION: Our results warrant further analysis of plasma ceramides as potential markers for MCI in middle-aged men. In contrast to previous studies, no associations of plasma sphingolipids with MCI or brain volumes were found in women, independent of age. These results highlight the importance of accounting for sex- and age-related factors when examining sphingolipid and CERT metabolism related to cognitive function.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE: Resective epilepsy surgery is an evidence-based curative treatment option for patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The major preoperative predictor of a good surgical outcome is detection of an epileptogenic lesion by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Application of ultra-high field (UHF) MRI, i.e. field strengths >/= 7 Tesla (T), may increase the sensitivity to detect such a lesion. METHODS: A keyword search strategy was submitted to Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database and clinicaltrials.gov to select studies on UHF MRI in patients with epilepsy. Follow-up study selection and data extraction were performed following PRISMA guidelines. We focused on I) diagnostic gain of UHF- over conventional MRI, II) concordance of MRI-detected lesion, seizure onset zone and surgical decision-making, and III) postoperative histopathological diagnosis and seizure outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen observational cohort studies, all using 7T MRI were included. Diagnostic gain of 7T over conventional MRI ranged from 8% to 67%, with a pooled gain of 31%. Novel techniques to visualize pathological processes in epilepsy and lesion detection are discussed. Seizure freedom was achieved in 73% of operated patients; no seizure outcome comparison was made between 7T MRI positive, 7T negative and 3T positive patients. 7T could influence surgical decision-making, with high concordance of lesion and seizure onset zone. Focal cortical dysplasia (54%), hippocampal sclerosis (12%) and gliosis (8.1%) were the most frequently diagnosed histopathological entities. SIGNIFICANCE: UHF MRI increases, yet variably, the sensitivity to detect an epileptogenic lesion, showing potential for use in clinical practice. It remains to be established whether this results in improved seizure outcome after surgical treatment. Prospective studies with larger cohorts of epilepsy patients, uniform scan and sequence protocols, and innovative post-processing technology are equally important as further increasing field strengths. Besides technical ameliorations, improved correlation of imaging features with clinical semiology, histopathology and clinical outcome has to be established.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Resective epilepsy surgery is a well-established, evidence-based treatment option in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. A major predictive factor of good surgical outcome is visualization and delineation of a potential epileptogenic lesion by MRI. However, frequently, these lesions are subtle and may escape detection by conventional MRI (</= 3 T). METHODS: We present the EpiUltraStudy protocol to address the hypothesis that application of ultra-high field (UHF) MRI increases the rate of detection of structural lesions and functional brain aberrances in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who are candidates for resective epilepsy surgery. Additionally, therapeutic gain will be addressed, testing whether increased lesion detection and tailored resections result in higher rates of seizure freedom 1 year after epilepsy surgery. Sixty patients enroll the study according to the following inclusion criteria: aged >/= 12 years, diagnosed with drug-resistant focal epilepsy with a suspected epileptogenic focus, negative conventional 3 T MRI during pre-surgical work-up. RESULTS: All patients will be evaluated by 7 T MRI; ten patients will undergo an additional 9.4 T MRI exam. Images will be evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists and a neurologist or neurosurgeon. Clinical and UHF MRI will be discussed in the multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery conference. Demographic and epilepsy characteristics, along with postoperative seizure outcome and histopathological evaluation, will be recorded. CONCLUSION: This protocol was reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Review Board and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and principles of Good Clinical Practice. Results will be submitted to international peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: www.trialregister.nl : NTR7536.},

   abstract = {The brain can be considered a network, existing of multiple interconnected areas with various functions. MRI provides opportunities to map the large-scale network organization of the brain. We tap into the neurobiochemical dimension of these networks, as neuronal functioning and signal trafficking across distributed brain regions relies on the release and presence of neurotransmitters. Using high-field MR spectroscopic imaging at 7.0T, we obtained a non-invasive snapshot of the spatial distribution of the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate, and investigated interregional associations of these neurotransmitters. We demonstrate that interregional correlations of glutamate and GABA concentrations can be conceptualized as networks. Furthermore, patients with epilepsy display an increased number of glutamate and GABA connections and increased average strength of the GABA network. The increased glutamate and GABA connectivity in epilepsy might indicate a disrupted neurotransmitter balance. In addition to epilepsy, the 'neurotransmitter networks' concept might also provide new insights for other neurological diseases.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: While PRESS is often employed to measure glutamate concentrations, MEGA-PRESS enables simultaneous Glx (glutamate and glutamine) and GABA measurements. This study aimed to compare validation, repeatability, and concordance of different approaches for glutamate quantification at 3T to aid future studies in their selection of the appropriate sequence and quantification method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine phantoms with different glutamate and glutamine concentrations and five healthy participants were scanned twice to assess respectively the validation and repeatability of measurements with PRESS and MEGA-PRESS. To assess concordance between the different methods, results from 95 human participants were compared. PRESS, MEGA-PRESS (i.e. difference), and the MEGA-PRESS OFF spectra were analyzed with both LCModel and Gannet. RESULTS: In vitro, excellent agreement was shown between actual and measured glutamate concentrations for all measurements (r>0.98). In vivo CVs were better for PRESS (2.9%) than MEGA-PRESS (4.9%) and MEGA-PRESS OFF (4.2%). However, the concordance between the sequences was low (PRESS and MEGA-PRESS OFF, r=0.3) to modest (MEGA-PRESS versus MEGA-PRESS OFF, r=0.8). CONCLUSION: Both PRESS and MEGA-PRESS can be employed to measure in vivo glutamate concentrations, although PRESS shows a better repeatability. Comparisons between in vivo glutamate measures of different sequences however need to be interpreted cautiously.},

   abstract = {As a large number of patients with epilepsy do not respond favorably to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), a better understanding of treatment failure and the cause of adverse side effects is required. The working mechanisms of AEDs also alter neurotransmitter concentrations and brain activity, which can be measured using MR spectroscopy and functional MR imaging, respectively. This review presents an overview of clinical research of MR spectroscopy and functional MR imaging studies to the effects of AEDs on the brain. Despite the scarcity of studies associating MR findings to the effectiveness of AEDs, the current research shows clear potential regarding this matter. Several GABAergic AEDs have been shown to increase the GABA concentration, which was related to seizure reductions, while language problems due to topiramate have been associated with altered activation patterns measured with functional MR imaging. MR spectroscopy and functional MR imaging provide biomarkers that may predict individual treatment outcomes, and enable the assessment of mechanisms of treatment failure and cognitive side effects.},

   abstract = {AIM: To increase our insight in the neuronal mechanisms underlying cognitive side-effects of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. METHODS: The relation between functional magnetic resonance-acquired brain network measures, AED use, and cognitive function was investigated. Three groups of patients with epilepsy with a different risk profile for developing cognitive side effects were included: A "low risk" category (lamotrigine or levetiracetam, n = 16), an "intermediate risk" category (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, or valproate, n = 34) and a "high risk" category (topiramate, n = 5). Brain connectivity was assessed using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and graph theoretical network analysis. The Computerized Visual Searching Task was used to measure central information processing speed, a common cognitive side effect of AED treatment. RESULTS: Central information processing speed was lower in patients taking AEDs from the intermediate and high risk categories, compared with patients from the low risk category. The effect of risk category on global efficiency was significant (P < 0.05, ANCOVA), with a significantly higher global efficiency for patient from the low category compared with the high risk category (P < 0.05, post-hoc test). Risk category had no significant effect on the clustering coefficient (ANCOVA, P > 0.2). Also no significant associations between information processing speed and global efficiency or the clustering coefficient (linear regression analysis, P > 0.15) were observed. CONCLUSION: Only the four patients taking topiramate show aberrant network measures, suggesting that alterations in functional brain network organization may be only subtle and measureable in patients with more severe cognitive side effects.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are effective in suppressing epileptic seizures, they also induce (cognitive) side effects, with mental slowing as a general effect. This study aimed to assess whether concentrations of MR detectable neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, are associated with mental slowing in patients with epilepsy taking AEDs. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected from patients with localization-related epilepsy using a variety of AEDs from three risk categories, i.e., AEDs with low, intermediate, and high risks of developing cognitive problems. Patients underwent 3T MR spectroscopy, including a PRESS (n=55) and MEGA-PRESS (n=43) sequence, to estimate occipital glutamate and GABA concentrations, respectively. The association was calculated between neurotransmitter concentrations and central information processing speed, which was measured using the Computerized Visual Searching Task (CVST) and compared between the different risk categories. RESULTS: Combining all groups, patients with lower processing speeds had lower glutamate concentrations. Patients in the high-risk category had a lower glutamate concentration and lower processing speed compared with patients taking low-risk AEDs. Patients taking intermediate-risk AEDs also had a lower glutamate concentration compared with patients taking low-risk AEDs, but processing speed did not differ significantly between those groups. No associations were found between the GABA concentration and risk category or processing speed. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a relation is shown between glutamate concentration and both mental slowing and AED use. It is suggested that the reduced excitatory action, reflected by lowered glutamate concentrations, may have contributed to the slowing of information processing in patients using AEDs with higher risks of cognitive side effects.},

   abstract = {The brain is a highly energetic organ. Although the brain can consume metabolic substrates, such as lactate, glycogen, and ketone bodies, the energy metabolism in a healthy adult brain mainly relies on glucose provided via blood. The cerebral metabolism of glucose produces energy and a wide variety of intermediate metabolites. Since cerebral metabolic alterations have been repeatedly implicated in several brain disorders, understanding changes in metabolite levels and corresponding cell-specific neurotransmitter fluxes through different substrate utilization may highlight the underlying mechanisms that can be exploited to diagnose or treat various brain disorders. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive tool to measure tissue metabolism in vivo. (1)H-MRS is widely applied in research at clinical field strengths (</=3T) to measure mostly high abundant metabolites. In addition, X-nuclei MRS including, (13)C, (2)H, (17)O, and (31)P, are also very promising. Exploiting the higher sensitivity at ultra-high-field (>4T; UHF) strengths enables obtaining unique insights into different aspects of the substrate metabolism towards measuring cell-specific metabolic fluxes in vivo. This review provides an overview about the potential role of multinuclear MRS ((1)H, (13)C, (2)H, (17)O, and (31)P) at UHF to assess the cerebral metabolism and the metabolic insights obtained by applying these techniques in both healthy and diseased states.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are associated with structural brain abnormalities, often observed in cognitive disorders. Besides visible lesions, (pre)diabetes might also be associated with alterations of the intrinsic organization of the white matter. In this population-based cohort study, the association of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes with white matter network organization was assessed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Maastricht Study, a type 2 diabetes-enriched population-based cohort study (1,361 subjects with normal glucose metabolism, 348 with prediabetes, and 510 with type 2 diabetes assessed by oral glucose tolerance test; 52% men; aged 59 +/- 8 years), 3 Tesla structural and diffusion MRI was performed. Whole-brain white matter tractography was used to assess the number of connections (node degree) between 94 brain regions and the topology (graph measures). Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to investigate the associations of glucose metabolism status with network measures. Associations were adjusted for age, sex, education, and cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes were associated with lower node degree after full adjustment (standardized [st]betaPrediabetes = -0.055 [95% CI -0.172, 0.062], stbetaType2diabetes = -0.256 [-0.379, -0.133], P trend < 0.001). Prediabetes was associated with lower local efficiency (stbeta = -0.084 [95% CI -0.159, -0.008], P = 0.033) and lower clustering coefficient (stbeta = -0.097 [95% CI -0.189, -0.005], P = 0.049), whereas type 2 diabetes was not. Type 2 diabetes was associated with higher communicability (stbeta = 0.148 [95% CI 0.042, 0.253], P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are associated with fewer white matter connections and weaker organization of white matter networks. Type 2 diabetes was associated with higher communicability, which was not yet observed in prediabetes and may reflect the use of alternative white matter connections.},

   abstract = {Cardiometabolic risk factors may be of key importance in the development of future brain diseases like dementia or depression. However, it remains unclear how these risk factors exactly affect the brain. Advanced MR imaging methods such as, diffusion weighted and functional MRI, can provide detailed insights into subtle brain changes, and potentially into early development of disease. In this narrative review, we summarize the available evidence on the associations of cardiometabolic risk factors with subtle changes in brain MRI measures. We found clear evidence that hyperglycemia, physical inactivity, central obesity, and hypertension are associated with both structural and functional brain alterations, while the role of dyslipidemia is far less clear. However, longitudinal evidence that assesses temporality of the associations with more advanced and thus more precise brain imaging methods is needed to improve our insights into the complex etiology of brain diseases.},

   abstract = {We assessed whether objectively measured low- and high-intensity physical activity (LPA and HPA) and sedentary time (ST) were associated with white matter connectivity, both throughout the whole brain and in brain regions involved in motor function. In the large population-based Maastricht Study (n = 1715, age 59.6 +/- 8.1 (mean +/- standard deviation) years, and 48% women), the amounts of LPA, HPA, and ST were objectively measured during 7 days by an activPAL accelerometer. In addition, using 3T structural and diffusion MRI, we calculated whole brain node degree and node degree of the basal ganglia and primary motor cortex. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed, and we report standardized regression coefficients (stbeta) adjusted for age, sex, education level, wake time, diabetes status, BMI, office systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, total-cholesterol-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio, lipid-modifying medication, alcohol use, smoking status, and history of cardiovascular disease. Lower HPA was associated with lower whole brain node degree after full adjustment (stbeta [95%CI] = - 0.062 [- 0.101, - 0.013]; p = 0.014), whereas lower LPA (stbeta [95%CI] = - 0.013 [- 0.061, 0.034]; p = 0.580) and higher ST (stbeta [95%CI] = - 0.030 [- 0.081, 0.021]; p = 0.250) was not. In addition, lower HPA was associated with lower node degree of the basal ganglia after full adjustment (stbeta [95%CI] = - 0.070 [- 0.121, - 0.018]; p = 0.009). Objectively measured lower HPA, but not lower LPA and higher ST, was associated with lower whole brain node degree and node degree in specific brain regions highly specialized in motor function. Further research is needed to establish whether more HPA may preserve structural brain connectivity.},

   abstract = {Background Lesions of cerebral small vessel disease, such as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, interfere with the trajectories of the white matter and eventually contribute to cognitive decline. However, there is no consensus yet about the precise underlying topological mechanism. Purpose To examine whether WMH and cognitive function are associated and whether any such association is mediated or explained by structural connectivity measures in an adult population. In addition, to investigate underlying local abnormalities in white matter by assessing the tract-specific WMH volumes and their tract-specific association with cognitive function. Materials and Methods In the prospective type 2 diabetes-enriched population-based Maastricht Study, structural and diffusion-tensor MRI was performed (December 2013 to February 2017). Total and tract-specific WMH volumes; network measures; cognition scores; and demographic, cardiovascular, and lifestyle characteristics were determined. Multivariable linear regression and mediation analyses were used to investigate the association of WMH volume, tract-specific WMH volumes, and network measures with cognitive function. Associations were adjusted for age, sex, education, diabetes status, and cardiovascular risk factors. Results A total of 5083 participants (mean age, 59 years +/- 9 [standard deviation]; 2592 men; 1027 with diabetes) were evaluated. Larger WMH volumes were associated with stronger local (standardized beta coefficient, 0.065; P < .001), but not global, network efficiency and lower information processing speed (standardized beta coefficient, -0.073; P < .001). Moreover, lower local efficiency (standardized beta coefficient, -0.084; P < .001) was associated with lower information processing speed. In particular, the relationship between WMHs and information processing speed was mediated (percentage mediated, 7.2% [95% CI: 3.5, 10.9]; P < .05) by the local network efficiency. Finally, WMH load was larger in the white matter tracts important for information processing speed. Conclusion White matter hyperintensity volume, local network efficiency, and information processing speed scores are interrelated, and local network properties explain lower cognitive performance due to white matter network alterations.

   abstract = {Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown can disrupt nutrient supply and waste removal, which affects neuronal functioning. Currently, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is the preferred in-vivo method to quantify BBB leakage. Dedicated DCE MRI studies in normal aging individuals are lacking, which could hamper value estimation and interpretation of leakage rate in pathological conditions. Therefore, we applied DCE MRI to investigate the association between BBB disruption and age in a healthy sample. Fifty-seven cognitively and neurologically healthy, middle-aged to older participants (mean age: 66 years, range: 47-91 years) underwent MRI, including DCE MRI with intravenous injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Pharmacokinetic modeling was applied to contrast concentration time-curves to estimate BBB leakage rate in each voxel. Subsequently, leakage rate was calculated in the white and gray matter, and primary (basic sensory and motor functions), secondary (association areas), and tertiary (higher-order cognition) brain regions. A difference in vulnerability to deterioration was expected between these regions, with especially tertiary regions being affected by age. Higher BBB leakage rate was significantly associated with older age in the white and gray matter, and also in tertiary, but not in primary or secondary brain regions. Even in healthy individuals, BBB disruption was stronger in older persons, which suggests BBB disruption is a normal physiologically aging phenomenon. Age-related increase in BBB disruption occurred especially in brain regions most vulnerable to age-related deterioration, which may indicate that BBB disruption is an underlying mechanism of normal age-related decline.Netherlands Trial Register number: NL6358, date of registration: 2017-03-24.},

   abstract = {To investigate whether blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a potential mechanism of usual age-related cognitive decline, we conducted dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to measure BBB leakage in a healthy sample, and investigated the association with longitudinal cognitive decline. In a sample of neurologically and cognitively healthy, older individuals, BBB leakage rate in the white and grey matter and hippocampus was measured using DCE MRI with pharmacokinetic modelling. Regression analysis was performed to investigate whether the leakage rate was associated with decline in cognitive performance (memory encoding, memory retrieval, executive functioning and processing speed) over 12 years. White and grey matter BBB leakages were significantly associated with decline in memory retrieval. No significant relations were found between hippocampal BBB leakage and cognitive performance. BBB disruption already being associated with usual cognitive ageing, supports that this neurovascular alteration is a possible explanation for the cognitive decline inherent to the ageing process. More insight into BBB leakage during the normal ageing process could improve estimation and interpretation of leakage rate in pathological conditions. The current results might also stimulate the search for strategies to maintain BBB integrity and help increase the proportion people experiencing successful ageing.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circumventricular organs (CVOs) are small structures without a blood-brain barrier surrounding the brain ventricles that serve homeostasic functions and facilitate communication between the blood, cerebrospinal fluid and brain. Secretory CVOs release peptides and sensory CVOs regulate signal transmission. However, pathogens may enter the brain through the CVOs and trigger neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. We investigated the feasibility of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to assess the CVO permeability characteristics in vivo, and expected significant contrast uptake in these regions, due to blood-brain barrier absence. METHODS: Twenty healthy, middle-aged to older males underwent brain DCE MRI. Pharmacokinetic modeling was applied to contrast concentration time-courses of CVOs, and in reference to white and gray matter. We investigated whether a significant and positive transfer from blood to brain could be measured in the CVOs, and whether this differed between secretory and sensory CVOs or from normal-appearing brain matter. RESULTS: In both the secretory and sensory CVOs, the transfer constants were significantly positive, and all secretory CVOs had significantly higher transfer than each sensory CVO. The transfer constants in both the secretory and sensory CVOs were higher than in the white and gray matter. CONCLUSIONS: Current measurements confirm the often-held assumption of highly permeable CVOs, of which the secretory types have the strongest blood-to-brain transfer. The current study suggests that DCE MRI could be a promising technique to further assess the function of the CVOs and how pathogens can potentially enter the brain via these structures.

The application of contrast-enhanced MRI in the assessment of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier integrity. Choroid plexus epithelial cells form a barrier that enables active, bidirectional exchange between the blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), known as the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB). Through its involvement in CSF composition, the BCSFB maintains homeostasis in the central nervous system. While the relation between blood-brain barrier disruption, aging and neurodegeneration is extensively studied using contrast-enhanced MRI, applying this technique to investigate BCSFB disruption in age-related neurodegeneration has received little attention. This review provides an overview of the current status of contrast-enhanced MRI to assess BCSFB permeability. Post-contrast ventricular gadolinium enhancement has been used to indicate BCSFB permeability. Moreover, new techniques highly sensitive to low gadolinium concentrations in the CSF, for instance heavily T2-weighted imaging with cerebrospinal fluid suppression, seem promising. Also, attempts are made at using other contrast agents, such as manganese ions or very small superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, that seem to be cleared from the brain at the choroid plexus. Advancing and applying new developments such as these could progress the assessment of BCSFB integrity.},

   abstract = {Neurovascular pathology concurs with protein accumulation, as the brain vasculature is important for waste clearance. Interstitial solutes, such as amyloid-beta, were previously thought to be primarily cleared from the brain by blood-brain barrier transport. Recently, the glymphatic system was discovered, in which cerebrospinal fluid is exchanged with interstitial fluid, facilitated by the aquaporin-4 water channels on the astroglial endfeet. Glymphatic flow can clear solutes from the interstitial space. Blood-brain barrier transport and glymphatic clearance likely serve complementary roles with partially overlapping mechanisms providing a well-conditioned neuronal environment. Disruption of these mechanisms can lead to protein accumulation and may initiate neurodegenerative disorders, for instance amyloid-beta accumulation and Alzheimer's disease. Although both mechanisms seem to have a similar purpose, their interaction has not been clearly discussed previously. This review focusses on this interaction in healthy and pathological conditions. Future health initiatives improving waste clearance might delay or even prevent onset of neurodegenerative disorders. Defining glymphatic flow kinetics using imaging may become an alternative way to identify those at risk of Alzheimer's disease.},

   abstract = {Objective- NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) and cardiac troponin T (cTNT) are associated with cognitive performance. Whether this extends to individuals <60 years of age is unclear. We investigated whether age modified the associations between NT-proBNP and cTNT and cognitive performance and structural brain changes. Approach and Results- In 3011 individuals (60+/-8 years; 49% women), NT-proBNP and cTNT, memory, information processing speed and executive functioning, grey matter (GM) and white matter, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes were determined. We used regression, adjusted for educational level, cardiovascular factors, and lifestyle factors, to test whether cross-sectional associations between biomarkers and cognitive performance and structural brain changes were modified by age (<60 versus >/=60 years). >/=60 years, higher NT-proBNP was associated with lower memory (beta [SD] per 10-fold higher level [95% confidence interval (CI)], -0.11 [-0.22 to -0.00]), information processing speed (-0.12 [95% CI, -0.21 to -0.03]), executive functioning (-0.12 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.03]), and smaller GM (beta [mL] per 10-fold higher level, -6.89 [95% CI, -11.58 to -2.20]). Additionally, higher cTNT was associated with lower memory (-0.33 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.12]) and information processing speed (-0.17 [95% CI, -0.3 to -0.01]); with smaller GM (-16.07 [95% CI, -24.90 to -7.24]) and greater WMH (10(beta) WMH per 10-fold higher level, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.10-0.52]). <60 years, NT-proBNP and cTNT were not associated with cognitive performance ( Pinteraction, <0.10). In contrast, higher NT-proBNP was associated with smaller GM (-7.43 [95% CI, -11.70 to -3.16]) and greater WMH (0.13 [95% CI, 0.01-0.25]; Pinteraction,>0.10). Higher cTNT was associated with greater WMH (0.18 [95% CI, -0.01 to 0.37]; Pinteraction,>0.10) but not with GM (0.07 [95% CI, -6.87 to 7.02]; Pinteraction, <0.10). Conclusions- Biomarkers of cardiac injury are continuously associated with structural brain changes in both older and younger individuals but with poorer cognitive performance only in older individuals. These findings stress the continuous nature of the heart-brain axis in the development of cognitive impairment.},

Glutamatergic pathways have been linked with cognition and are hypothesized to be disrupted in 22q11.2DS patients, possibly 'shifting' the excitatory (glutamate)/inhibitory (GABA) balance. Hence, the glutamate/GABA balance may constitute a target for pharmacological treatment. We aimed to examine alterations of glutamate/GABA metabolites in 22q11.2DS in vivo using riluzole, a compound with glutamate/GABA-modulating action, as pharmacological challenge. METHODS: Seventeen 22q11.2DS patients and 20 matched healthy controls were enrolled in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Glutamate and glutamine concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum, as well as ACC GABA concentrations were obtained after placebo and after a single dose of 50 mg riluzole using 7-Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Within the 22q11.2DS group, the relationship between metabolite concentrations and cognition was examined. RESULTS: No group differences were found in ACC and striatal metabolite concentrations following placebo. Riluzole numerically decreased ACC (eta(2) = 0.094) but not striatal glutamate concentrations as well as ACC GABA concentrations (eta(2) = 0.176) in all subjects. In both regions, riluzole did not alter glutamine concentration. No interaction effects were found. Although not significant after Bonferroni correction, ACC glutamate concentrations were inversely correlated with cognitive functions in 22q11.2DS patients. DISCUSSION: We did not demonstrate altered ACC and striatal metabolite concentrations in 22q11.2DS. Nevertheless, these results suggest that glutamate and GABA can be modulated with a single dose of riluzole. Possibly, riluzole may have memory-enhancing effects in 22q11.2DS. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of riluzole on cognition.},

   abstract = {Chronic epilepsy is frequently accompanied by serious cognitive side-effects. Clinical factors are important, but cannot account entirely for this cognitive comorbidity. Therefore, research is focusing on the underlying cerebral mechanisms to understand the development of cognitive dysfunction. In the past two decades, functional MRI techniques have been applied extensively to the study of cognitive impairment in chronic epilepsy. However, because of wide variation in study designs, analysis methods, and data presentation, interpretation of these studies has become increasingly difficult for clinicians. In patients with localisation-related epilepsy, whether findings of functional MRI represent the underlying neuronal substrate for cognitive decline remains a subject of debate.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Impaired memory performance is the most frequently reported cognitive problem in patients with chronic epilepsy. To examine memory deficits many studies have focused on the role of the mesiotemporal lobe, mostly with hippocampal abnormalities. However, the role of the prefrontal brain remains unresolved. To investigate the neuronal correlates of working memory dysfunction in patients without structural lesions, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment, hippocampal and cerebral volumetry, and functional magnetic resonance imaging of temporal and frontal memory networks was performed. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy and 21 healthy controls underwent neuropsychological assessment of intelligence (IQ) and memory. On T(1) -weighted images obtained by 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), volumetry of the hippocampi and the cerebrum was performed. Functional MRI (fMRI) was performed with a novel picture encoding and Sternberg paradigm that activated different memory-mediating brain regions. Functional connectivity analysis comprised cross-correlation of signal time-series of the most strongly activated regions involved in working memory function. KEY FINDINGS: Patients with epilepsy displayed lower IQ values; impaired transient aspects of information processing, as indicated by lower scores on the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST); and decreased short-term memory performance relative to healthy controls, as measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale subtests for working memory, and word and figure recognition. This could not be related to any hippocampal volume changes. No group differences were found regarding volumetry or fMRI-derived functional activation. In the Sternberg paradigm, a network involving the anterior cingulate and the middle and inferior frontal gyrus was activated. A reduced strength of four connections in this prefrontal network was associated with the DSST and word recognition performance in the patient group. SIGNIFICANCE: Deficits in the processes involved in transient working memory, and to a lesser extent in short-term memory, in patients with localization-related epilepsy of both temporal and extratemporal origin cannot be attributed to hippocampal atrophy or function only, but are also related to reduced functional connectivity in the prefrontal brain. Because patients with symptomatic lesions or mesiotemporal sclerosis were excluded from this study, the results cannot be explained by structural lesions. Therefore, the current findings highlight the influence of epilepsy on the prefrontal network integrity as a possible underlying problem of memory impairment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: An often underestimated cognitive morbidity in patients with epilepsy is language dysfunction. To investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying neuropsychological language impairment, activation maps and functional connectivity networks were studied by fMRI of language. METHOD: Fifty-two patients with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy and 27 healthy controls underwent neuropsychological assessment of IQ, word fluency, and text reading. fMRI was performed with a standard covert word-generation and text-reading paradigm. Functional connectivity analysis comprised cross-correlation of signal time series of the characteristic and most strongly activated regions involved in the language tasks. RESULTS: After careful selection, 34 patients and 20 healthy controls were found eligible for analysis. Patients displayed lower IQ, lower fluency word count, and lower number of words correctly read compared to controls. fMRI activation maps did not differ significantly between patients and controls. For the word-generation paradigm, patients with epilepsy had significantly lower functional connectivity than controls in the prefrontal network. Patients performing worse on the word-fluency test demonstrated a significantly lower mean functional connectivity than controls. Text reading demonstrated lower functional connectivity in patients with epilepsy in the frontotemporal network. Similarly, lower mean functional connectivity was observed in patients with lowest reading performance compared to controls. A relation between reduced functional connectivity and performance on word-fluency and text-reading tests was demonstrated in epilepsy patients. CONCLUSION: Impaired performance on language assessment in epilepsy patients is associated with loss of functional connectivity in the cognitive language networks.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cognitive dysfunction is a frequent comorbid disorder in epilepsy which has been associated with high seizure frequency. We examined the effect of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCS) on cognitive dysfunction using neuropsychological assessment and fMRI. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with localization-related epilepsy of varying etiologies and SGTCS underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment. Functional MRI was performed probing the frontal and temporal lobes with two paradigms aimed at investigating speed of mental processing and working memory. RESULTS: A high number of total lifetime SGTCS was associated with lower intelligence scores. Moreover, a trend towards cognitive decline related to the number of SGTCS was observed. A relatively increased prefrontal activation related to the number of SGTCS was demonstrated, plus a trend towards a decreased activation in the frontotemporal areas. CONCLUSION: High numbers of SGTCS are associated with a drop in intelligence scores and altered prefrontal brain activation. A shift from frontotemporal to prefrontal activation seems to have occurred, suggesting that a functional reorganization of working memory is induced by a high number of SGTCS. It remains uncertain if this reorganization reflects a compensation mechanism, or the underlying pathological processes of cognitive dysfunction.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between possibly altered whole brain topology and intellectual decline in chronic epilepsy, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment and graph theoretical network analysis of fMRI was performed. METHODS: Forty-one adult patients with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy and 23 healthy controls underwent an intelligence test and fMRI with a silent-word generation paradigm. A set of undirected graphs was constructed by cross-correlating the signal time series of 893 cortical and subcortical regions. Possible changes in cerebral network efficiency were assessed by performing graph theoretical network analysis. RESULTS: Healthy subjects displayed efficient small world properties, characterized by high clustering and short path lengths. On the contrary, in patients with epilepsy a disruption of both local segregation and global integration was found. An association of more pronounced intellectual decline with more disturbed local segregation was observed in the patient group. The effect of antiepileptic drug use on cognitive decline was mediated by decreased clustering. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that chronic localization-related epilepsy causes cognitive deficits by inducing global cerebral network changes instead of a localized disruption only. Whether this is the result of epilepsy per se or the use of antiepileptic drugs remains to be elucidated. For application in clinical practice, future studies should address the relevance of altered cerebral network topology in prediction of cognitive deficits and monitoring of therapeutic interventions.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To obtain better microstructural integrity, interstitial fluid, and microvascular images from multi-b-value diffusion MRI data by using a physics-informed neural network (PINN) fitting approach. METHODS: Test-retest whole-brain inversion recovery diffusion-weighted images with multiple b-values (IVIM: intravoxel incoherent motion) were acquired on separate days for 16 patients with cerebrovascular disease on a 3.0T MRI system. The performance of the PINN three-component IVIM (3C-IVIM) model fitting approach was compared with conventional fitting approaches (i.e., non-negative least squares and two-step least squares) in terms of (1) parameter map quality, (2) test-retest repeatability, and (3) voxel-wise accuracy. Using the in vivo data, the parameter map quality was assessed by the parameter contrast-to-noise ratio (PCNR) between normal-appearing white matter and white matter hyperintensities, and test-retest repeatability was expressed by the coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The voxel-wise accuracy of the 3C-IVIM parameters was determined by 10,000 computer simulations mimicking our in vivo data. Differences in PCNR and CV values obtained with the PINN approach versus conventional fitting approaches were assessed using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: The PINN-derived 3C-IVIM parameter maps were of higher quality and more repeatable than those of conventional fitting approaches, while also achieving higher voxel-wise accuracy. CONCLUSION: Physics-informed neural networks enable robust voxel-wise estimation of three diffusion components from the diffusion-weighted signal. The repeatable and high-quality biological parameter maps generated with PINNs allow for visual evaluation of pathophysiological processes in cerebrovascular disease.},

   abstract = {Perivascular spaces (PVS) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption are two key features of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and neurodegenerative diseases that have been linked to cognitive impairment and are involved in the cerebral waste clearance system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers the possibility to study these pathophysiological processes noninvasively in vivo. This educational review provides an overview of the MRI techniques used to assess PVS functionality and BBB disruption. MRI-visible PVS can be scored on structural images by either (subjectively) counting or (automatically) delineating the PVS. We highlight emerging (diffusion) techniques to measure proxies of perivascular fluid and its movement, which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of PVS in diseases. For the measurement of BBB disruption, we explain the most commonly used MRI technique, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, as well as a more recently developed technique based on arterial spin labeling (ASL). DCE MRI and ASL are thought to measure complementary characteristics of the BBB. Furthermore, we describe clinical studies that have utilized these MRI techniques in cSVD and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). These studies demonstrate the role of PVS and BBB dysfunction in these diseases and provide insight into the large overlap, but also into the differences between cSVD and AD. Overall, MRI techniques may provide valuable insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these diseases and have the potential to be used as markers for disease progression and treatment response.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) remains a challenge and is currently based on the assessment of clinical symptoms. PD is also a heterogeneous disease with great variability in symptoms, disease course, and response to therapy. There is a general need for a better understanding of this heterogeneity and the interlinked long-term changes in brain function and structure in PD. Over the past years there is increasing interest in the value of new paradigms in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the potential of ultra-high field strength imaging in the diagnostic work-up of PD. With this multimodal 7 T MRI study, our objectives are: 1) To identify distinctive MRI characteristics in PD patients and to create a diagnostic tool based on these differences. 2) To correlate MRI characteristics to clinical phenotype, genetics and progression of symptoms. 3) To detect future imaging biomarkers for disease progression that could be valuable for the evaluation of new therapies. METHODS: The TRACK-PD study is a longitudinal observational study in a cohort of 130 recently diagnosed (</= 3 years after diagnosis) PD patients and 60 age-matched healthy controls (HC). A 7 T MRI of the brain will be performed at baseline and repeated after 2 and 4 years. Complete assessment of motor, cognitive, neuropsychiatric and autonomic symptoms will be performed at baseline and follow-up visits with wearable sensors, validated questionnaires and rating scales. At baseline a blood DNA sample will also be collected. DISCUSSION: This is the first longitudinal, observational, 7 T MRI study in PD patients. With this study, an important contribution can be made to the improvement of the current diagnostic process in PD. Moreover, this study will be able to provide valuable information related to the different clinical phenotypes of PD and their correlating MRI characteristics. The long-term aim of this study is to better understand PD and develop new biomarkers for disease progression which may help new therapy development. Eventually, this may lead to predictive models for individual PD patients and towards personalized medicine in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register, NL7558 .

STUDY TYPE: Prospective cross-sectional study. POPULATION: Patients with cSVD (n = 69, median age 69.8) and controls (n = 39, median age 68.9). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Whole-brain inversion recovery IVIM acquisition at 3.0T. ASSESSMENT: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) were rated by three raters. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) were identified on a fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image using a semiautomated algorithm. STATISTICAL TESTS: Relations between IVIM measures and cSVD-related lesions were studied using the Spearman's rank order correlation. RESULTS: NNLS yielded diffusion spectra from which the intermediate volume fraction fint was apparent between parenchymal diffusion and microvasular pseudodiffusion. WMH volume and the extent of MRI-visible enlarged PVS in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO) were correlated with fint in the WMHs, BG, and CSO, respectively. fint was 4.2 +/- 1.7%, 7.0 +/- 4.1% and 13.6 +/- 7.7% in BG and 3.9 +/- 1.3%, 4.4 +/- 1.4% and 4.5 +/- 1.2% in CSO for the groups with low, moderate, and high number of enlarged PVS, respectively, and increased with the extent of enlarged PVS (BG: r = 0.49, P < 0.01; CSO: r = 0.23, P = 0.02). fint in the WMHs was 27.1 +/- 13.1%, and increased with the WMH volume (r = 0.57, P < 0.01). DATA CONCLUSION: We revealed the presence of an intermediate diffusion component in lesion-prone regions of cSVD and demonstrated its relation with enlarged PVS and WMHs. In tissue with these lesions, tissue degeneration or perivascular edema can lead to more freely diffusing interstitial fluid contributing to fint . LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravoxel incoherent motion imaging can measure both microvascular and parenchymal abnormalities simultaneously. The contamination of CSF signal can be suppressed using inversion recovery preparation. The clinical feasibility of inversion recovery-intravoxel incoherent motion imaging was investigated in patients with cerebrovascular disease by studying its reproducibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with cerebrovascular disease (66 +/- 8 years of age) underwent inversion recovery-intravoxel incoherent motion imaging twice. The reproducibility of the perfusion volume fraction and parenchymal diffusivity was calculated with the coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and the repeatability coefficient. ROIs included the normal-appearing white matter, cortex, deep gray matter, white matter hyperintensities, and vascular lesions. RESULTS: Values for the perfusion volume fraction ranged from 2.42 to 3.97 x10(-2) and for parenchymal diffusivity from 7.20 to 9.11 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s, with higher values found in the white matter hyperintensities and vascular lesions. Coefficients of variation were <3.70% in normal-appearing tissue and <9.15% for lesions. Intraclass correlation coefficients were good to excellent, showing values ranging from 0.82 to 0.99 in all ROIs, except the deep gray matter and cortex, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.66 and 0.54, respectively. The repeatability coefficients ranged from 0.15 to 0.96 x 10(-2) and 0.10 to 0.37 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s for perfusion volume fraction and parenchymal diffusivity, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Good reproducibility of inversion recovery-intravoxel incoherent motion imaging was observed with low coefficients of variation and high intraclass correlation coefficients in normal-appearing tissue and lesion areas in cerebrovascular disease. Good reproducibility of inversion recovery-intravoxel incoherent motion imaging in cerebrovascular disease is feasible in monitoring disease progression or treatment responses in the clinic.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the link between blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the relation with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with cSVD received dynamic susceptibility contrast and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to determine CBF and BBB permeability (expressed as leakage rate and volume), respectively. Structural MRI were segmented into normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and WMH, for which a perilesional zone was defined. In these regions, we investigated the BBB permeability, CBF, and their relation using Pearson correlation r. RESULTS: We found a decrease in CBF of 2.2 mL/min/100 g (p < 0.01) and an increase in leakage volume of 0.7% (p < 0.01) per mm closer to the WMH in the perilesional zones. Lower CBF values correlated with higher leakage measures in the NAWM and WMH (-0.53 < r < -0.40, p < 0.05). This relation was also observed in the perilesional zones, which became stronger in the proximity of WMH (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: BBB impairment and hypoperfusion appear in the WMH and NAWM, which increase in the proximity of the WMH, and are linked. Both BBB and CBF are regulated in the neurovascular unit (NVU) and the observed link might be due to the physiologic regulation mechanism of the NVU. This link may suggest an early overall deterioration of this unit.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability has been shown to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease and it may provide an early functional marker of progression or treatment effects. The aim of the study was to investigate the test-retest reproducibility and influencing factors of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in measuring subtle leakage in patients with cerebrovascular disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DCE-MRI (3T) was performed on two separate days in 16 patients (age 66 +/- 9 years) with cerebrovascular disease, prospectively. The leakage rate was quantified for white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) using the Patlak graphical approach with individual vascular input functions (VIFs). Furthermore, the influence of session-averaged VIFs, the average of the VIFs obtained on two days, and shorter scan times (range 5-25 minutes) on the reproducibility were evaluated in WM and GM. RESULTS: Coefficients of variation (CV) </=14.4% (WM and GM), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.77 (WM) and 0.49 (GM), were observed for the leakage rate. Session-averaged VIFs hardly affected these results (CV </=13.4%). The repeatability coefficients (RCs) of the leakage rate decreased from 2.7.10(-3) to 0.4.10(-3) min(-1) in WM (P < 0.01) and 4.4.10(-3) to 0.9.10(-3) min(-1) in GM (P < 0.01) with increasing scan time (range 5-25 minutes). CONCLUSION: Based on the moderate CVs and moderate-to-excellent ICCs, we demonstrate that measuring subtle BBB leakage using DCE-MRI is moderate-to-excellent reproducible. Longer scan times improve the reproducibility. The provided RCs at various scan times may assist future clinical studies investigating BBB leakage using DCE-MRI.

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is associated with microvascular and parenchymal alterations. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI has been proposed to simultaneously measure both the microvascular perfusion and parenchymal diffusivity. This study aimed to evaluate the application of IVIM in cSVD to assess the microvasculature and parenchymal microstructure. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with cSVD (age 70 +/- 11 y) and thirty-nine controls (age 69 +/- 12 y) underwent IVIM imaging (3T). Group differences of the perfusion volume fraction f and the parenchymal diffusivity D were investigated using multivariable linear regression accounted for age, sex and cardiovascular factors. To examine the relation between the IVIM measures and the disease severity on structural MRI, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load served as surrogate measure of the disease severity. RESULTS: Patients had a larger f (p < 0.024) in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) than controls. Higher D (p < 0.031) was also observed for patients compared with controls in the NAWM and grey matter. Both f (p < 0.024) and D (p < 0.001) in the NAWM and grey matter increased with WMH load. CONCLUSIONS: The increased diffusivity reflects the predicted microstructural tissue impairment in cSVD. Unexpectedly, an increased perfusion volume fraction was observed in patients. Future studies are needed to reveal the precise nature of the increased perfusion volume fraction. IVIM imaging showed that the increases of f and D in cSVD were both related to disease severity, which suggests the potential of IVIM imaging to provide a surrogate marker for the progression of cSVD.},

We examined the relationship between BBB leakage and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and cognition, in cSVD patients and healthy controls. Seventy-seven patients with clinically overt cSVD and thirty-nine age matched healthy controls underwent dynamic contract-enhanced and structural brain MRI and neuropsychological assessment. We quantified BBB leakage volume and rate in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), WMH and cortical grey matter (CGM). Larger leakage volume and lower leakage rate in WMH were associated with larger WMH volume in cSVD but not in controls. Higher leakage rate in NAWM was associated with lower scores on executive function and information processing speed in healthy controls, whereas no relation with cognition was found in cSVD patients. Our findings support the involvement of BBB leakage in cSVD and aging. They also suggest that the mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in cSVD is more complex and multifactorial in cSVD compared with normal aging.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with cognitive impairment. This may be because of decreased microstructural integrity and microvascular perfusion, but data on these relationships are scarce. We determined the relationship between cognition and microvascular perfusion and microstructural integrity in SVD patients, using intravoxel incoherent motion imaging-a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging technique designed to determine microvascular perfusion and microstructural integrity simultaneously. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with SVD and 39 controls underwent intravoxel incoherent motion imaging and neuropsychological assessment. Parenchymal diffusivity D (a surrogate measure of microstructural integrity) and perfusion-related measure fD* were calculated for the normal appearing white matter, white matter hyperintensities, and cortical gray matter. The associations between cognitive performance and D and fD* were determined. RESULTS: In SVD patients, multivariable analysis showed that lower fD* in the normal appearing white matter and cortical gray matter was associated with lower overall cognition (P=0.03 and P=0.002, respectively), lower executive function (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively), and lower information-processing speed (P=0.04 and P=0.01, respectively). D was not associated with cognitive function. In controls, no association was found between D, fD*, and cognition. CONCLUSIONS: In SVD patients, lower cognitive performance is associated with lower microvascular perfusion in the normal appearing white matter and cortical gray matter. Our results support recent findings that both cortical gray matter and normal appearing white matter perfusion may play a role in the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in SVD.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may occur in normal aging but may also play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), we used dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI to quantify the rate and the spatial extent of BBB leakage in patients with cSVD and age- and sex-matched controls to discern cSVD-related BBB leakage from aging-related leakage. METHODS: We performed structural brain MRI and DCE-MRI in 80 patients with clinically overt cSVD and 40 age- and sex-matched controls. Using the Patlak pharmacokinetic model, we calculated the leakage rate. The mean leakage rate and relative leakage volume were calculated using noise-corrected histogram analysis. Leakage rate and leakage volume were compared between patients with cSVD and controls for the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cortical gray matter (CGM), and deep gray matter. RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression analyses adjusting for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors showed that the leakage volume of the NAWM, WMH, and CGM was significantly larger in patients with cSVD compared with controls. No significant difference was found for leakage rate in any of the tissue regions. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a larger tissue volume with subtle BBB leakage in patients with cSVD than in controls. This was shown in the NAWM, WMH, and CGM, supporting the generalized nature of cSVD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microvascular dysfunction (MVD) contributes to stroke, dementia, depression, retinopathy and chronic kidney disease. However, the determinants of MVD are incompletely understood. Greater blood pressure variability (BPV) may be one such determinant. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used cross-sectional data of The Maastricht Study (n = 2773, age 59.9 years; 51.9% men) to investigate whether greater very short- to mid-term BPV is associated with various MVD measures. We standardized and averaged within-visit, 24-h and 7-day BPV into a systolic and a diastolic BPV composite score. MVD measures included a composite score of MRI cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) features (total brain parenchymal volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts and cerebral microbleeds), a composite score of flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation response, albuminuria, heat-induced skin hyperemia and a composite score of plasma biomarkers of MVD (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sE-selectin and von Willebrand Factor). We used linear regression adjusted for age, sex, glucose metabolism status, mean 24-h systolic or DBP, cardiovascular risk factors and antihypertensive medication. We found that higher systolic and diastolic BPV composite scores (per SD) were associated with higher albuminuria [higher ratio, 1.04 (95% CI 1.00-1.08) and 1.07 (1.03-1.11), respectively], but not with other measures of MVD tested. CONCLUSION: Greater systolic and diastolic BPV was associated with higher albuminuria, but not with CSVD features, flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation response, heat-induced skin hyperemia and plasma biomarkers of MVD. This suggests that the microvasculature of the kidneys is most vulnerable to the detrimental effects of greater BPV.},
